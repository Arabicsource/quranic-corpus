3105,2,173,10,[with it]
3106,2,173,11,to other than
3107,2,173,12,Allah.
3108,2,173,13,So whoever
3109,2,173,14,(is) forced by necessity
3110,2,173,15,without
3111,2,173,16,(being) disobedient
3112,2,173,17,and not
3113,2,173,18,"transgressor,"
3114,2,173,19,then no
3115,2,173,20,sin
3116,2,173,21,on him.
3117,2,173,22,"Indeed,"
3118,2,173,23,Allah
3119,2,173,24,"(is) Oft-Forgiving,"
3120,2,173,25,Most Merciful.
3121,2,174,1,"Indeed,"
3122,2,174,2,those who
3123,2,174,3,conceal
3124,2,174,4,what
3125,2,174,5,(has) revealed
3126,2,174,6,Allah (has)
3127,2,174,7,of
3128,2,174,8,"the Book,"
3129,2,174,9,and they purchase
3130,2,174,10,there with
3131,2,174,11,a gain
3132,2,174,12,little.
3133,2,174,13,"Those,"
3134,2,174,14,not
3135,2,174,15,they eat
3136,2,174,16,in
3137,2,174,17,their bellies
3138,2,174,18,except
3139,2,174,19,the Fire.
3140,2,174,20,And not
3141,2,174,21,will speak to them
3142,2,174,22,Allah
3143,2,174,23,(on the) Day
3144,2,174,24,(of) [the] Judgment
3145,2,174,25,and not
3146,2,174,26,"will He purify them,"
3147,2,174,27,and for them
3148,2,174,28,(is) a punishment
3149,2,174,29,painful.
3150,2,175,1,Those
3151,2,175,2,(are) they who
3152,2,175,3,purchase[d]
3153,2,175,4,[the] astraying
3154,2,175,5,"for [the] Guidance,"
3155,2,175,6,and [the] punishment
3156,2,175,7,for [the] forgiveness.
3157,2,175,8,So what (is)
3158,2,175,9,their endurance
3159,2,175,10,on
3160,2,175,11,the Fire!
3161,2,176,1,That
3162,2,176,2,(is) because
3163,2,176,3,Allah
3164,2,176,4,revealed
3165,2,176,5,the Book
3166,2,176,6,with [the] Truth.
3167,2,176,7,"And indeed,"
3168,2,176,8,those
3169,2,176,9,who differed
3170,2,176,10,in
3171,2,176,11,the Book
3172,2,176,12,(are) surely in
3173,2,176,13,schism
3174,2,176,14,far.
3175,2,177,1,It is not
3176,2,177,2,[the] righteousness
3177,2,177,3,that
3178,2,177,4,you turn
3179,2,177,5,your faces
3180,2,177,6,towards
3181,2,177,7,the east
3182,2,177,8,"and the west,"
3183,2,177,9,[and] but
3184,2,177,10,the righteous[ness]
3185,2,177,11,(is he) who
3186,2,177,12,believes
3187,2,177,13,in Allah
3188,2,177,14,and the Day
3189,2,177,15,"[the] Last,"
3190,2,177,16,"and the Angels,"
3191,2,177,17,"and the Book,"
3192,2,177,18,"and the Prophets,"
3193,2,177,19,and gives
3194,2,177,20,the wealth
3195,2,177,21,in
3196,2,177,22,spite of his love (for it)
3197,2,177,23,(to) those
3198,2,177,24,"(of) the near relatives,"
3199,2,177,25,"and the orphans,"
3200,2,177,26,"and the needy,"
3201,2,177,27,and (of)
3202,2,177,28,"the wayfarer,"
3203,2,177,29,"and those who ask,"
3204,2,177,30,and in
3205,2,177,31,freeing the necks (slaves)
3206,2,177,32,and (who) establish
3207,2,177,33,"the prayer,"
3208,2,177,34,and give
3209,2,177,35,"the zakah,"
3210,2,177,36,and those who fulfill
3211,2,177,37,their covenant
3212,2,177,38,when
3213,2,177,39,they make it;
3214,2,177,40,and those who are patient
3215,2,177,41,in
3216,2,177,42,[the] suffering
3217,2,177,43,"and [the] hardship,"
3218,2,177,44,and (the) time
3219,2,177,45,(of) [the] stress.
3220,2,177,46,Those
3221,2,177,47,(are) the ones who
3222,2,177,48,are true
3223,2,177,49,"and those,"
3224,2,177,50,[they]
3225,2,177,51,(are) the righteous.
3226,2,178,1,O you
3227,2,178,2,who
3228,2,178,3,believe[d]!
3229,2,178,4,Prescribed
3230,2,178,5,for you
3231,2,178,6,(is) the legal retribution
3232,2,178,7,in
3233,2,178,8,"(the matter of) the murdered,"
3234,2,178,9,the freeman
3235,2,178,10,"for the freeman,"
3236,2,178,11,and the slave
3237,2,178,12,"for the slave,"
3238,2,178,13,and the female
3239,2,178,14,for the female.
3240,2,178,15,But whoever
3241,2,178,16,is pardoned
3242,2,178,17,[for it]
3243,2,178,18,from
3244,2,178,19,his brother
3245,2,178,20,"anything,"
3246,2,178,21,then follows up
3247,2,178,22,with suitable
3248,2,178,23,[and] payment
3249,2,178,24,to him
3250,2,178,25,with kindness.
3251,2,178,26,That (is)
3252,2,178,27,a concession
3253,2,178,28,from
3254,2,178,29,your Lord
3255,2,178,30,and mercy.
3256,2,178,31,Then whoever
3257,2,178,32,transgresses
3258,2,178,33,after
3259,2,178,34,"that,"
3260,2,178,35,then for him
3261,2,178,36,(is) a punishment
3262,2,178,37,painful.
3263,2,179,1,And for you
3264,2,179,2,in
3265,2,179,3,the legal retribution
3266,2,179,4,"(is) life,"
3267,2,179,5,O men
3268,2,179,6,(of) understanding!
3269,2,179,7,So that you may
3270,2,179,8,(become) righteous.
3271,2,180,1,Prescribed
3272,2,180,2,for you
3273,2,180,3,when
3274,2,180,4,approaches
3275,2,180,5,any of you
3276,2,180,6,"[the] death,"
3277,2,180,7,if
3278,2,180,8,he leaves
3279,2,180,9,good
3280,2,180,10,(making) the will
3281,2,180,11,for the parents
3282,2,180,12,and the near relatives
3283,2,180,13,with due fairness
3284,2,180,14,a duty
3285,2,180,15,on
3286,2,180,16,the righteous ones.
3287,2,181,1,Then whoever
3288,2,181,2,changes it
3289,2,181,3,after what
3290,2,181,4,"he (has) heard [it],"
3291,2,181,5,so only
3292,2,181,6,its sin
3293,2,181,7,(would be) on
3294,2,181,8,those who
3295,2,181,9,alter it.
3296,2,181,10,"Indeed,"
3297,2,181,11,Allah
3298,2,181,12,"(is) All-Hearing,"
3299,2,181,13,All-Knowing.
3300,2,182,1,But whoever
3301,2,182,2,fears
3302,2,182,3,from
3303,2,182,4,(the) testator
3304,2,182,5,(any) error
3305,2,182,6,or
3306,2,182,7,"sin,"
3307,2,182,8,then reconciles
3308,2,182,9,"between them,"
3309,2,182,10,then (there is) no
3310,2,182,11,sin
3311,2,182,12,on him.
3312,2,182,13,"Indeed,"
3313,2,182,14,Allah
3314,2,182,15,"(is) Oft-Forgiving,"
3315,2,182,16,All-Merciful.
3316,2,183,1,O you
3317,2,183,2,who
3318,2,183,3,believe[d]!
3319,2,183,4,Is prescribed
3320,2,183,5,for you
3321,2,183,6,[the] fasting
3322,2,183,7,as
3323,2,183,8,was prescribed
3324,2,183,9,to
3325,2,183,10,those
3326,2,183,11,from
3327,2,183,12,"before you,"
3328,2,183,13,so that you may
3329,2,183,14,(become) righteous.
3330,2,184,1,(Fasting for) days
3331,2,184,2,numbered.
3332,2,184,3,So whoever
3333,2,184,4,is
3334,2,184,5,among you
3335,2,184,6,sick
3336,2,184,7,or
3337,2,184,8,on
3338,2,184,9,"a journey,"
3339,2,184,10,then a prescribed number
3340,2,184,11,of
3341,2,184,12,days
3342,2,184,13,other.
3343,2,184,14,And on
3344,2,184,15,those who
3345,2,184,16,"can afford it,"
3346,2,184,17,a ransom
3347,2,184,18,(of) feeding
3348,2,184,19,a poor.
3349,2,184,20,And whoever
3350,2,184,21,volunteers
3351,2,184,22,good
3352,2,184,23,then it
3353,2,184,24,(is) better
3354,2,184,25,for him.
3355,2,184,26,And to
3356,2,184,27,fast
3357,2,184,28,(is) better
3358,2,184,29,"for you,"
3359,2,184,30,if
3360,2,184,31,you
3361,2,184,32,know.
3362,2,185,1,Month
3363,2,185,2,(of) Ramadhaan
3364,2,185,3,(is) that
3365,2,185,4,was revealed
3366,2,185,5,therein
3367,2,185,6,"the Quran,"
3368,2,185,7,a Guidance
3369,2,185,8,for mankind
3370,2,185,9,and clear proofs
3371,2,185,10,of
3372,2,185,11,[the] Guidance
3373,2,185,12,and the Criterion.
3374,2,185,13,So whoever
3375,2,185,14,witnesses
3376,2,185,15,among you
3377,2,185,16,"the month,"
3378,2,185,17,"then he should fast in it,"
3379,2,185,18,and whoever
3380,2,185,19,is
3381,2,185,20,sick
3382,2,185,21,or
3383,2,185,22,on
3384,2,185,23,a journey
3385,2,185,24,then prescribed number (should be made up)
3386,2,185,25,from
3387,2,185,26,days
3388,2,185,27,other.
3389,2,185,28,Intends
3390,2,185,29,Allah
3391,2,185,30,for you
3392,2,185,31,[the] ease
3393,2,185,32,and not
3394,2,185,33,intends
3395,2,185,34,for you
3396,2,185,35,"[the] hardship,"
3397,2,185,36,so that you complete
3398,2,185,37,the prescribed period
3399,2,185,38,and that you magnify
3400,2,185,39,Allah
3401,2,185,40,for
3402,2,185,41,[what]
3403,2,185,42,He guided you
3404,2,185,43,so that you may
3405,2,185,44,(be) grateful.
3406,2,186,1,And when
3407,2,186,2,ask you
3408,2,186,3,My servants
3409,2,186,4,"about Me,"
3410,2,186,5,then indeed I am
3411,2,186,6,near.
3412,2,186,7,I respond
3413,2,186,8,(to the) invocation
3414,2,186,9,(of) the supplicant
3415,2,186,10,when
3416,2,186,11,he calls Me.
3417,2,186,12,So let them respond
3418,2,186,13,to Me
3419,2,186,14,and let them believe
3420,2,186,15,"in Me,"
3421,2,186,16,so that they may
3422,2,186,17,(be) led aright.
3423,2,187,1,Permitted
3424,2,187,2,for you
3425,2,187,3,(in the) nights
3426,2,187,4,(of) fasting
3427,2,187,5,(is) the approach
3428,2,187,6,to
3429,2,187,7,your wives.
3430,2,187,8,They
3431,2,187,9,(are) garments
3432,2,187,10,for you
3433,2,187,11,and you
3434,2,187,12,(are) garments
3435,2,187,13,for them.
3436,2,187,14,Knows
3437,2,187,15,Allah
3438,2,187,16,that you
3439,2,187,17,used to
3440,2,187,18,deceive
3441,2,187,19,"yourselves,"
3442,2,187,20,so He turned
3443,2,187,21,towards you
3444,2,187,22,and He forgave
3445,2,187,23,[on] you.
3446,2,187,24,So now
3447,2,187,25,have relations with them
3448,2,187,26,and seek
3449,2,187,27,what
3450,2,187,28,has ordained
3451,2,187,29,Allah
3452,2,187,30,for you.
3453,2,187,31,And eat
3454,2,187,32,and drink
3455,2,187,33,until
3456,2,187,34,becomes distinct
3457,2,187,35,to you
3458,2,187,36,the thread
3459,2,187,37,[the] white
3460,2,187,38,from
3461,2,187,39,the thread
3462,2,187,40,[the] black
3463,2,187,41,of
3464,2,187,42,[the] dawn.
3465,2,187,43,Then
3466,2,187,44,complete
3467,2,187,45,the fast
3468,2,187,46,till
3469,2,187,47,the night.
3470,2,187,48,And (do) not
3471,2,187,49,have relations with them
3472,2,187,50,while you
3473,2,187,51,(are) secluded
3474,2,187,52,in
3475,2,187,53,the masajid.
3476,2,187,54,These
3477,2,187,55,(are the) limits
3478,2,187,56,"(set by) Allah,"
3479,2,187,57,so (do) not
3480,2,187,58,approach them.
3481,2,187,59,Thus
3482,2,187,60,makes clear
3483,2,187,61,Allah
3484,2,187,62,His verses
3485,2,187,63,for [the] people
3486,2,187,64,so that they may
3487,2,187,65,(become) righteous.
3488,2,188,1,And (do) not
3489,2,188,2,eat
3490,2,188,3,your properties
3491,2,188,4,among yourselves
3492,2,188,5,wrongfully
3493,2,188,6,and present
3494,2,188,7,[with] it
3495,2,188,8,to
3496,2,188,9,the authorities
3497,2,188,10,so that you may eat
3498,2,188,11,a portion
3499,2,188,12,from
3500,2,188,13,(the) wealth
3501,2,188,14,(of) the people
3502,2,188,15,sinfully
3503,2,188,16,while you
3504,2,188,17,know.
3505,2,189,1,They ask you
3506,2,189,2,about
3507,2,189,3,the new moons.
3508,2,189,4,"Say,"
3509,2,189,5,"""They"
3510,2,189,6,(are) indicators of periods
3511,2,189,7,"for the people,"
3512,2,189,8,"and (for) the Hajj."""
3513,2,189,9,And it is not
3514,2,189,10,[the] righteousness
3515,2,189,11,that
3516,2,189,12,you come
3517,2,189,13,(to) the houses
3518,2,189,14,from
3519,2,189,15,"their backs,"
3520,2,189,16,[and] but
3521,2,189,17,[the] righteous

3567,2,191,23,Such
3568,2,191,24,(is the) reward

4375,2,228,19,in Allah
4376,2,228,20,and the Day
4377,2,228,21,[the] Last.
4378,2,228,22,And their husbands
4379,2,228,23,(have) better right
4380,2,228,24,to take them back
4381,2,228,25,in
4382,2,228,26,that (period)
4383,2,228,27,if
4384,2,228,28,they wish
4385,2,228,29,(for) reconciliation.
4386,2,228,30,And for them
4387,2,228,31,(is the) like
4388,2,228,32,(of) that which
4389,2,228,33,(is) on them
4390,2,228,34,"in a reasonable manner,"
4391,2,228,35,and for the men
4392,2,228,36,over them
4393,2,228,37,(is) a degree.
4394,2,228,38,And Allah
4395,2,228,39,"(is) All-Mighty,"
4396,2,228,40,All-Wise.
4397,2,229,1,The divorce
4398,2,229,2,(is) twice.
4399,2,229,3,Then to retain

4401,2,229,5,or
4402,2,229,6,to release (her)
4403,2,229,7,with kindness.
4404,2,229,8,And (it is) not
4405,2,229,9,lawful
4406,2,229,10,for you
4407,2,229,11,that
4408,2,229,12,you take (back)
4409,2,229,13,whatever
4410,2,229,14,you have given them
4411,2,229,15,"anything,"
4412,2,229,16,except
4413,2,229,17,if
4414,2,229,18,both fear
4415,2,229,19,that not
4416,2,229,20,they both (can) keep
4417,2,229,21,(the) limits

4422,2,229,26,they both (can) keep
4423,2,229,27,(the) limits
4424,2,229,28,(of) Allah
4425,2,229,29,then (there is) no
4426,2,229,30,sin
4427,2,229,31,on both of them
4428,2,229,32,in what
4429,2,229,33,she ransoms
4430,2,229,34,concerning it.
4431,2,229,35,These
4432,2,229,36,(are the) limits

4434,2,229,38,so (do) not
4435,2,229,39,transgress them.
4436,2,229,40,And whoever

4438,2,229,42,(the) limits
4439,2,229,43,(of) Allah
4440,2,229,44,then those -
4441,2,229,45,they
4442,2,229,46,(are) the wrongdoers.
4443,2,230,1,Then if
4444,2,230,2,"he divorces her,"
4445,2,230,3,then (she is) not
4446,2,230,4,lawful
4447,2,230,5,for him
4448,2,230,6,from

4450,2,230,8,until
4451,2,230,9,she marries
4452,2,230,10,a spouse
4453,2,230,11,other than him.
4454,2,230,12,Then if
4455,2,230,13,he divorces her
4456,2,230,14,then no
4457,2,230,15,sin

4459,2,230,17,if
4460,2,230,18,they return to each other
4461,2,230,19,if
4462,2,230,20,they believe
4463,2,230,21,that
4464,2,230,22,they (will be able to) keep
4465,2,230,23,(the) limits.
4466,2,230,24,(of) Allah.
4467,2,230,25,And these
4468,2,230,26,(are the) limits.
4469,2,230,27,(of) Allah.
4470,2,230,28,He makes them clear
4471,2,230,29,to a people
4472,2,230,30,who know.
4473,2,231,1,And when
4474,2,231,2,you divorce
4475,2,231,3,the women
4476,2,231,4,and they reach
4477,2,231,5,"their (waiting) term,"
4478,2,231,6,then retain them
4479,2,231,7,in a fair manner
4480,2,231,8,or
4481,2,231,9,release them
4482,2,231,10,in a fair manner.
4483,2,231,11,And (do) not
4484,2,231,12,retain them
4485,2,231,13,(to) hurt
4486,2,231,14,so that you transgress.
4487,2,231,15,And whoever
4488,2,231,16,does
4489,2,231,17,"that,"
4490,2,231,18,"then indeed,"
4491,2,231,19,he wronged
4492,2,231,20,himself.
4493,2,231,21,And (do) not
4494,2,231,22,take
4495,2,231,23,(the) Verses
4496,2,231,24,(of) Allah
4497,2,231,25,"(in) jest,"

4507,2,231,35,and [the] wisdom;
4508,2,231,36,He instructs you
4509,2,231,37,with it.
4510,2,231,38,And fear

4518,2,232,1,And when
4519,2,232,2,you divorce
4520,2,232,3,[the] women
4521,2,232,4,and they reached
4522,2,232,5,"their (waiting) term,"
4523,2,232,6,then (do) not
4524,2,232,7,hinder them

4526,2,232,9,(from) marrying
4527,2,232,10,their husbands
4528,2,232,11,when

4530,2,232,13,between themselves
4531,2,232,14,in a fair manner.
4532,2,232,15,That
4533,2,232,16,is admonished

5998,2,282,117,"you do,"
5999,2,282,118,then indeed it

6015,2,283,6,you find
6016,2,283,7,"a scribe,"
6017,2,283,8,then pledge

8242,3,123,5,while you (were)
8243,3,123,6,weak.
8244,3,123,7,So fear
8245,3,123,8,Allah
8246,3,123,9,so that you may
8247,3,123,10,(be) grateful.
8248,3,124,1,When
8249,3,124,2,you said
8250,3,124,3,"to the believers,"
8251,3,124,4,"""Is it not"
8252,3,124,5,enough for you
8253,3,124,6,that
8254,3,124,7,reinforces you
8255,3,124,8,your Lord
8256,3,124,9,with three
8257,3,124,10,thousand[s]
8258,3,124,11,[of]
8259,3,124,12,[the] Angels
8260,3,124,13,[the ones] sent down?
8261,3,125,1,"Yes,"
8262,3,125,2,if
8263,3,125,3,you are patient
8264,3,125,4,and fear (Allah)
8265,3,125,5,and they come upon you
8266,3,125,6,[of]
8267,3,125,7,"suddenly,"
8268,3,125,8,[this]
8269,3,125,9,will reinforce you
8270,3,125,10,your Lord
8271,3,125,11,with five

8273,3,125,13,[of]
8274,3,125,14,[the] Angels
8275,3,125,15,[the ones] having marks.
8276,3,126,1,And not
8277,3,126,2,made it
8278,3,126,3,Allah
8279,3,126,4,except
8280,3,126,5,(as) good news
8281,3,126,6,for you
8282,3,126,7,and to reassure
8283,3,126,8,your hearts
8284,3,126,9,with it.
8285,3,126,10,And (there is) no
8286,3,126,11,[the] victory

8290,3,126,15,"Allah,"
8291,3,126,16,"the All-Mighty,"
8292,3,126,17,the All-Wise.
8293,3,127,1,That He may cut off
8294,3,127,2,a part
8295,3,127,3,of
8296,3,127,4,those who
8297,3,127,5,disbelieved
8298,3,127,6,or
8299,3,127,7,suppress them
8300,3,127,8,so (that) they turn back
8301,3,127,9,disappointed.
8302,3,128,1,Not
8303,3,128,2,for you
8304,3,128,3,of
8305,3,128,4,the decision
8306,3,128,5,(of) anything
8307,3,128,6,whether
8308,3,128,7,He turns
8309,3,128,8,to them
8310,3,128,9,or
8311,3,128,10,punishes them
8312,3,128,11,"for indeed, they"
8313,3,128,12,(are) wrongdoers.
8314,3,129,1,And to Allah (belongs)
8315,3,129,2,what
8316,3,129,3,(is) in
8317,3,129,4,the heavens
8318,3,129,5,and what
8319,3,129,6,(is) in
8320,3,129,7,"the earth,"
8321,3,129,8,He forgives
8322,3,129,9,[for] whom
8323,3,129,10,He wills
8324,3,129,11,and punishes
8325,3,129,12,whom
8326,3,129,13,He wills.
8327,3,129,14,And Allah
8328,3,129,15,"(is) Oft-Forgiving,"
8329,3,129,16,Most Merciful.
8330,3,130,1,O you
8331,3,130,2,who
8332,3,130,3,believe!
8333,3,130,4,(Do) not
8334,3,130,5,eat
8335,3,130,6,the usury
8336,3,130,7,doubled
8337,3,130,8,multiplied.
8338,3,130,9,And fear
8339,3,130,10,Allah
8340,3,130,11,so that you may
8341,3,130,12,(be) successful.
8342,3,131,1,And fear
8343,3,131,2,the Fire
8344,3,131,3,which
8345,3,131,4,is prepared
8346,3,131,5,for the disbelievers.
8347,3,132,1,And obey
8348,3,132,2,Allah
8349,3,132,3,and the Messenger
8350,3,132,4,so that you may
8351,3,132,5,receive mercy.
8352,3,133,1,And hasten
8353,3,133,2,to
8354,3,133,3,forgiveness
8355,3,133,4,from
8356,3,133,5,your Lord
8357,3,133,6,and a Garden -
8358,3,133,7,its width
8359,3,133,8,(is like that of) the heavens
8360,3,133,9,and the earth
8361,3,133,10,prepared
8362,3,133,11,for the pious.
8363,3,134,1,Those who
8364,3,134,2,spend
8365,3,134,3,in
8366,3,134,4,[the] ease
8367,3,134,5,and (in) the hardship
8368,3,134,6,and those who restrain
8369,3,134,7,the anger
8370,3,134,8,and those who pardon
8371,3,134,9,[from]
8372,3,134,10,the people -
8373,3,134,11,and Allah
8374,3,134,12,loves
8375,3,134,13,the good-doers.
8376,3,135,1,And those
8377,3,135,2,when
8378,3,135,3,they did
8379,3,135,4,immorality
8380,3,135,5,or
8381,3,135,6,wronged
8382,3,135,7,themselves -
8383,3,135,8,they remember
8384,3,135,9,Allah
8385,3,135,10,then ask forgiveness
8386,3,135,11,for their sins -
8387,3,135,12,and who
8388,3,135,13,(can) forgive
8389,3,135,14,the sins
8390,3,135,15,except
8391,3,135,16,Allah?
8392,3,135,17,And not
8393,3,135,18,they persist
8394,3,135,19,on
8395,3,135,20,what
8396,3,135,21,they did
8397,3,135,22,while they
8398,3,135,23,know.
8399,3,136,1,Those -
8400,3,136,2,their reward
8401,3,136,3,(is) forgiveness
8402,3,136,4,from
8403,3,136,5,their Lord
8404,3,136,6,and Gardens
8405,3,136,7,flows
8406,3,136,8,from
8407,3,136,9,underneath it
8408,3,136,10,"the rivers,"
8409,3,136,11,abiding forever
8410,3,136,12,in it.
8411,3,136,13,And an excellent
8412,3,136,14,reward
8413,3,136,15,(for) the (righteous) workers.
8414,3,137,1,Verily
8415,3,137,2,passed
8416,3,137,3,from
8417,3,137,4,before you
8418,3,137,5,"situations,"
8419,3,137,6,then travel
8420,3,137,7,in
8421,3,137,8,the earth
8422,3,137,9,and see
8423,3,137,10,how
8424,3,137,11,was
8425,3,137,12,(the) end
8426,3,137,13,(of) the deniers.
8427,3,138,1,This
8428,3,138,2,(is) a declaration
8429,3,138,3,for the people
8430,3,138,4,and guidance
8431,3,138,5,and admonition
8432,3,138,6,for the God-fearing.
8433,3,139,1,And (do) not
8434,3,139,2,weaken
8435,3,139,3,and (do) not
8436,3,139,4,grieve
8437,3,139,5,and you (will be)
8438,3,139,6,"[the] superior,"
8439,3,139,7,if
8440,3,139,8,you are
8441,3,139,9,believers.
8442,3,140,1,If
8443,3,140,2,touched you
8444,3,140,3,"a wound,"
8445,3,140,4,so certainly
8446,3,140,5,(has) touched
8447,3,140,6,the people
8448,3,140,7,wound
8449,3,140,8,like it.
8450,3,140,9,And this
8451,3,140,10,[the] days
8452,3,140,11,We alternate them
8453,3,140,12,among
8454,3,140,13,the people
8455,3,140,14,[and] so that makes evident
8456,3,140,15,Allah
8457,3,140,16,those who
8458,3,140,17,believe[d]
8459,3,140,18,and take
8460,3,140,19,from you
8461,3,140,20,martyrs.
8462,3,140,21,And Allah
8463,3,140,22,(does) not
8464,3,140,23,love
8465,3,140,24,the wrongdoers.
8466,3,141,1,And so that may purify
8467,3,141,2,Allah
8468,3,141,3,those who
8469,3,141,4,believe
8470,3,141,5,and destroy
8471,3,141,6,the disbelievers.
8472,3,142,1,Or
8473,3,142,2,do you think
8474,3,142,3,that
8475,3,142,4,you will enter
8476,3,142,5,Paradise
8477,3,142,6,while has not yet
8478,3,142,7,made evident
8479,3,142,8,Allah
8480,3,142,9,those who
8481,3,142,10,strove hard
8482,3,142,11,among you
8483,3,142,12,and made evident
8484,3,142,13,the steadfast.
8485,3,143,1,And certainly
8486,3,143,2,you used to
8487,3,143,3,wish
8488,3,143,4,(for) death
8489,3,143,5,from
8490,3,143,6,before
8491,3,143,7,[that]
8492,3,143,8,"you met it,"
8493,3,143,9,"then indeed,"
8494,3,143,10,you have seen it
8495,3,143,11,while you (were)
8496,3,143,12,looking on.
8497,3,144,1,And not
8498,3,144,2,(is) Muhammad -
8499,3,144,3,except
8500,3,144,4,"a Messenger,"
8501,3,144,5,certainly
8502,3,144,6,passed away
8503,3,144,7,from
8504,3,144,8,before him
8505,3,144,9,[the] (other) Messengers.
8506,3,144,10,So if
8507,3,144,11,he died
8508,3,144,12,or
8509,3,144,13,is slain
8510,3,144,14,will you turn back
8511,3,144,15,on
8512,3,144,16,your heels?
8513,3,144,17,And whoever
8514,3,144,18,turns back
8515,3,144,19,on
8516,3,144,20,his heels
8517,3,144,21,then never
8518,3,144,22,will he harm
8519,3,144,23,Allah
8520,3,144,24,(in) anything.
8521,3,144,25,And will reward
8522,3,144,26,Allah
8523,3,144,27,the grateful ones.
8524,3,145,1,And not
8525,3,145,2,is
8526,3,145,3,for a soul
8527,3,145,4,that
8528,3,145,5,he dies
8529,3,145,6,except
8530,3,145,7,by (the) permission
8531,3,145,8,"(of) Allah,"
8532,3,145,9,(at a) decree
8533,3,145,10,determined.
8534,3,145,11,And whoever
8535,3,145,12,desires
8536,3,145,13,reward
8537,3,145,14,(of) the world -
8538,3,145,15,We will give him
8539,3,145,16,thereof;
8540,3,145,17,and whoever
8541,3,145,18,desires
8542,3,145,19,reward
8543,3,145,20,(of) the Hereafter
8544,3,145,21,We will give him
8545,3,145,22,thereof.
8546,3,145,23,And We will reward
8547,3,145,24,the grateful ones.
8548,3,146,1,And how many
8549,3,146,2,from
8550,3,146,3,a Prophet
8551,3,146,4,fought;
8552,3,146,5,with him
8553,3,146,6,(were) religious scholars
8554,3,146,7,many.
8555,3,146,8,But not
8556,3,146,9,they lost heart
8557,3,146,10,for what
8558,3,146,11,befell them
8559,3,146,12,in
8560,3,146,13,(the) way
8561,3,146,14,(of) Allah
8562,3,146,15,and not
8563,3,146,16,they weakened
8564,3,146,17,and not
8565,3,146,18,they gave in.
8566,3,146,19,And Allah
8567,3,146,20,loves
8568,3,146,21,the patient ones.
8569,3,147,1,And not
8570,3,147,2,were
8571,3,147,3,their words
8572,3,147,4,except
8573,3,147,5,that
8574,3,147,6,"they said,"
8575,3,147,7,"""Our Lord"
8576,3,147,8,forgive
8577,3,147,9,for us
8578,3,147,10,our sins
8579,3,147,11,and our excesses
8580,3,147,12,in
8581,3,147,13,our affairs
8582,3,147,14,and make firm
8583,3,147,15,our feet
8584,3,147,16,and give us victory
8585,3,147,17,over
8586,3,147,18,[the people]
8587,3,147,19,"the disbelievers."""
8588,3,148,1,So gave them
8589,3,148,2,Allah
8590,3,148,3,reward
8591,3,148,4,(in) the world
8592,3,148,5,and good
8593,3,148,6,reward
8594,3,148,7,(in) the Hereafter.
8595,3,148,8,And Allah
8596,3,148,9,loves
8597,3,148,10,the good-doers.
8598,3,149,1,O you
8599,3,149,2,who
8600,3,149,3,believe!
8601,3,149,4,If
8602,3,149,5,you obey
8603,3,149,6,those who
8604,3,149,7,"disbelieve,"
8605,3,149,8,they will turn you back
8606,3,149,9,on
8607,3,149,10,"your heels,"
8608,3,149,11,then you will turn back
8609,3,149,12,(as) losers.
8610,3,150,1,"Nay,"
8611,3,150,2,Allah
8612,3,150,3,(is) your Protector
8613,3,150,4,and He
8614,3,150,5,(is the) best
8615,3,150,6,(of) the Helpers.
8616,3,151,1,We will cast
8617,3,151,2,in
8618,3,151,3,(the) hearts
8619,3,151,4,(of) those who
8620,3,151,5,disbelieve
8621,3,151,6,[the] terror
8622,3,151,7,because
8623,3,151,8,they associated partners
8624,3,151,9,"with Allah,"
8625,3,151,10,what
8626,3,151,11,not
8627,3,151,12,He sent down
8628,3,151,13,about it
8629,3,151,14,"any authority,"
8630,3,151,15,and their refuge
8631,3,151,16,(will be) the Fire
8632,3,151,17,and wretched
8633,3,151,18,(is the) abode
8634,3,151,19,[of] the wrongdoers.
8635,3,152,1,And certainly
8636,3,152,2,fulfilled to you
8637,3,152,3,Allah
8638,3,152,4,"His promise,"
8639,3,152,5,when
8640,3,152,6,you were killing them
8641,3,152,7,"by His permission,"
8642,3,152,8,until
8643,3,152,9,when
8644,3,152,10,you lost courage
8645,3,152,11,and you fell into dispute
8646,3,152,12,concerning
8647,3,152,13,the order
8648,3,152,14,and you disobeyed
8649,3,152,15,from
8650,3,152,16,after
8651,3,152,17,[what]
8652,3,152,18,He (had) shown you
8653,3,152,19,what
8654,3,152,20,you love.
8655,3,152,21,Among you
8656,3,152,22,(are some) who
8657,3,152,23,desire
8658,3,152,24,the world
8659,3,152,25,and among you
8660,3,152,26,(are some) who
8661,3,152,27,desire
8662,3,152,28,the Hereafter.
8663,3,152,29,Then
8664,3,152,30,He diverted you
8665,3,152,31,from them
8666,3,152,32,so that He may test you.
8667,3,152,33,And surely

9629,4,1,3,Fear
9630,4,1,4,your Lord
9631,4,1,5,the One Who

9667,4,2,13,"Indeed, it"
9668,4,2,14,is
9669,4,2,15,a sin
9670,4,2,16,great.
9671,4,3,1,And if

9675,4,3,5,with
9676,4,3,6,"the orphans,"
9677,4,3,7,then marry

9724,4,5,12,and clothe them
9725,4,5,13,and speak

9729,4,6,1,And test
9730,4,6,2,the orphans
9731,4,6,3,until

9733,4,6,5,they reach[ed]
9734,4,6,6,"(the age of) marriage,"
9735,4,6,7,then if
9736,4,6,8,you perceive
9737,4,6,9,in them

9746,4,6,18,(fearing) that
9747,4,6,19,they will grow up.
9748,4,6,20,And whoever
9749,4,6,21,is
9750,4,6,22,rich
9751,4,6,23,"then he should refrain,"
9752,4,6,24,and whoever
9753,4,6,25,is
9754,4,6,26,poor
9755,4,6,27,then let him eat (of it)
9756,4,6,28,in a fair manner.
9757,4,6,29,Then when
9758,4,6,30,you deliver
9759,4,6,31,to them
9760,4,6,32,their wealth
9761,4,6,33,then take witnesses
9762,4,6,34,on them.
9763,4,6,35,And is sufficient

10391,4,30,5,"and injustice,"
10392,4,30,6,then soon
10393,4,30,7,We (will) cast him
10394,4,30,8,(into) a Fire.
10395,4,30,9,And is
10396,4,30,10,that
10397,4,30,11,for
10398,4,30,12,Allah
10399,4,30,13,easy.
10400,4,31,1,If
10401,4,31,2,you avoid
10402,4,31,3,great (sins)
10403,4,31,4,(of) what
10404,4,31,5,you are forbidden
10405,4,31,6,"from [it],"
10406,4,31,7,We will remove
10407,4,31,8,from you
10408,4,31,9,your evil deeds
10409,4,31,10,and We will admit you
10410,4,31,11,(to) an entrance
10411,4,31,12,noble.
10412,4,32,1,And (do) not
10413,4,32,2,covet
10414,4,32,3,what
10415,4,32,4,(has) bestowed
10416,4,32,5,Allah
10417,4,32,6,[with it]
10418,4,32,7,some of you
10419,4,32,8,over
10420,4,32,9,others.
10421,4,32,10,For men
10422,4,32,11,(is) a share
10423,4,32,12,of what
10424,4,32,13,"they earned,"
10425,4,32,14,and for women
10426,4,32,15,(is) a share
10427,4,32,16,of what
10428,4,32,17,they earned.
10429,4,32,18,And ask
10430,4,32,19,Allah
10431,4,32,20,of
10432,4,32,21,His bounty.
10433,4,32,22,"Indeed,"
10434,4,32,23,Allah
10435,4,32,24,is
10436,4,32,25,of every
10437,4,32,26,thing
10438,4,32,27,All-Knower.
10439,4,33,1,And for all
10440,4,33,2,We (have) made
10441,4,33,3,heirs
10442,4,33,4,of what
10443,4,33,5,(is) left
10444,4,33,6,(by) the parents
10445,4,33,7,and the relatives.
10446,4,33,8,And those whom
10447,4,33,9,pledged
10448,4,33,10,your right hands -
10449,4,33,11,then give them
10450,4,33,12,their share.
10451,4,33,13,"Indeed,"
10452,4,33,14,Allah
10453,4,33,15,is
10454,4,33,16,over
10455,4,33,17,every
10456,4,33,18,thing
10457,4,33,19,a Witness.
10458,4,34,1,[The] men
10459,4,34,2,(are) protectors
10460,4,34,3,of
10461,4,34,4,the women
10462,4,34,5,because
10463,4,34,6,(has) bestowed
10464,4,34,7,Allah
10465,4,34,8,some of them
10466,4,34,9,over
10467,4,34,10,others
10468,4,34,11,and because
10469,4,34,12,they spend
10470,4,34,13,from
10471,4,34,14,their wealth.
10472,4,34,15,So the righteous women
10473,4,34,16,"(are) obedient,"
10474,4,34,17,guarding
10475,4,34,18,in the unseen
10476,4,34,19,that which
10477,4,34,20,(orders) them to guard
10478,4,34,21,(by) Allah.
10479,4,34,22,And those (from) whom
10480,4,34,23,you fear
10481,4,34,24,their ill-conduct
10482,4,34,25,"then advise them,"
10483,4,34,26,and forsake them
10484,4,34,27,in
10485,4,34,28,the bed
10486,4,34,29,and [finally] strike them.
10487,4,34,30,Then if
10488,4,34,31,they obey you
10489,4,34,32,then (do) not
10490,4,34,33,seek
10491,4,34,34,against them
10492,4,34,35,a way.
10493,4,34,36,"Indeed,"
10494,4,34,37,Allah
10495,4,34,38,is
10496,4,34,39,"Most High,"
10497,4,34,40,Most Great.
10498,4,35,1,And if
10499,4,35,2,you fear
10500,4,35,3,a dissension
10501,4,35,4,"between (the) two of them,"
10502,4,35,5,then send
10503,4,35,6,an arbitrator
10504,4,35,7,from
10505,4,35,8,his family
10506,4,35,9,and an arbitrator
10507,4,35,10,from
10508,4,35,11,her family.
10509,4,35,12,If
10510,4,35,13,they both wish
10511,4,35,14,"reconciliation,"
10512,4,35,15,will cause reconciliation
10513,4,35,16,Allah
10514,4,35,17,between both of them.
10515,4,35,18,"Indeed,"
10516,4,35,19,Allah
10517,4,35,20,is
10518,4,35,21,"All-Knower,"
10519,4,35,22,All-Aware.
10520,4,36,1,And worship
10521,4,36,2,Allah
10522,4,36,3,And (do) not
10523,4,36,4,associate
10524,4,36,5,with Him
10525,4,36,6,"anything,"
10526,4,36,7,and to the parents
10527,4,36,8,"(do) good,"
10528,4,36,9,and with
10529,4,36,10,"the relatives,"
10530,4,36,11,"and the orphans,"
10531,4,36,12,and the needy
10532,4,36,13,and the neighbor
10533,4,36,14,(who is)
10534,4,36,15,"near,"
10535,4,36,16,and the neighbor
10536,4,36,17,"(who is) farther away,"
10537,4,36,18,and the companion
10538,4,36,19,by your side
10539,4,36,20,and the
10540,4,36,21,traveler
10541,4,36,22,and what
10542,4,36,23,possess[ed]
10543,4,36,24,your right hands.
10544,4,36,25,"Indeed,"
10545,4,36,26,Allah
10546,4,36,27,(does) not
10547,4,36,28,love
10548,4,36,29,(the one) who
10549,4,36,30,is
10550,4,36,31,[a] proud
10551,4,36,32,(and) [a] boastful.
10552,4,37,1,Those who
10553,4,37,2,are stingy
10554,4,37,3,and order
10555,4,37,4,the people
10556,4,37,5,[of] stinginess
10557,4,37,6,and hide
10558,4,37,7,what
10559,4,37,8,(has) given them
10560,4,37,9,Allah
10561,4,37,10,of
10562,4,37,11,His Bounty -
10563,4,37,12,and We (have) prepared
10564,4,37,13,for the disbelievers
10565,4,37,14,a punishment
10566,4,37,15,humiliating.
10567,4,38,1,And those who
10568,4,38,2,spend
10569,4,38,3,their wealth
10570,4,38,4,to be seen
10571,4,38,5,(by) the people
10572,4,38,6,and not
10573,4,38,7,they believe
10574,4,38,8,in Allah
10575,4,38,9,and not
10576,4,38,10,in the Day
10577,4,38,11,"the Last,"
10578,4,38,12,and whoever
10579,4,38,13,has
10580,4,38,14,the Shaitaan
10581,4,38,15,for him
10582,4,38,16,(as) companion -
10583,4,38,17,then evil
10584,4,38,18,(is he as) a companion.
10585,4,39,1,And what
10586,4,39,2,(is) against them
10587,4,39,3,if
10588,4,39,4,they believed
10589,4,39,5,in Allah
10590,4,39,6,and the Day
10591,4,39,7,the Last
10592,4,39,8,and spent
10593,4,39,9,from what
10594,4,39,10,(has) provided them
10595,4,39,11,Allah?
10596,4,39,12,And is
10597,4,39,13,Allah
10598,4,39,14,about them
10599,4,39,15,All-Knower.
10600,4,40,1,"Indeed,"
10601,4,40,2,Allah
10602,4,40,3,(does) not
10603,4,40,4,wrong
10604,4,40,5,(as much as) weight
10605,4,40,6,(of) an atom.
10606,4,40,7,And if
10607,4,40,8,there is
10608,4,40,9,a good
10609,4,40,10,He doubles it
10610,4,40,11,and gives
10611,4,40,12,from
10612,4,40,13,near Him
10613,4,40,14,a reward
10614,4,40,15,great.
10615,4,41,1,So how (will it be)
10616,4,41,2,when
10617,4,41,3,We bring
10618,4,41,4,from
10619,4,41,5,every
10620,4,41,6,nation
10621,4,41,7,a witness
10622,4,41,8,and We bring
10623,4,41,9,you
10624,4,41,10,against
10625,4,41,11,these (people)
10626,4,41,12,(as) a witness.
10627,4,42,1,(On) that Day
10628,4,42,2,will wish
10629,4,42,3,those who
10630,4,42,4,disbelieved
10631,4,42,5,and disobeyed
10632,4,42,6,the Messenger
10633,4,42,7,if
10634,4,42,8,was leveled
10635,4,42,9,with them
10636,4,42,10,the earth
10637,4,42,11,and not
10638,4,42,12,they will (be able to) hide
10639,4,42,13,(from) Allah
10640,4,42,14,(any) statement.
10641,4,43,1,O you
10642,4,43,2,who
10643,4,43,3,believe[d]!
10644,4,43,4,(Do) not
10645,4,43,5,go near
10646,4,43,6,the prayer
10647,4,43,7,while you
10648,4,43,8,(are) intoxicated
10649,4,43,9,until
10650,4,43,10,you know
10651,4,43,11,what
10652,4,43,12,you are saying
10653,4,43,13,and not
10654,4,43,14,(when you are) impure
10655,4,43,15,except
10656,4,43,16,(when) passing
10657,4,43,17,(through) a way
10658,4,43,18,until
10659,4,43,19,you have bathed.
10660,4,43,20,And if
10661,4,43,21,you are
10662,4,43,22,ill
10663,4,43,23,or
10664,4,43,24,on
10665,4,43,25,a journey
10666,4,43,26,or
10667,4,43,27,came
10668,4,43,28,one
10669,4,43,29,of you
10670,4,43,30,from
10671,4,43,31,"the toilet,"
10672,4,43,32,or
10673,4,43,33,you have touched
10674,4,43,34,the women
10675,4,43,35,and not
10676,4,43,36,you find
10677,4,43,37,"water,"
10678,4,43,38,then do tayammum
10679,4,43,39,(with) earth
10680,4,43,40,clean
10681,4,43,41,and wipe (with it)
10682,4,43,42,your faces
10683,4,43,43,and your hands.
10684,4,43,44,"Indeed,"
10685,4,43,45,Allah
10686,4,43,46,is
10687,4,43,47,"Oft-Pardoning,"
10688,4,43,48,Oft-Forgiving.
10689,4,44,1,Did not
10690,4,44,2,"you see,"
10691,4,44,3,[towards]
10692,4,44,4,those who
10693,4,44,5,were given
10694,4,44,6,a portion
10695,4,44,7,of
10696,4,44,8,"the Book,"
10697,4,44,9,purchasing

10701,4,44,13,you stray
10702,4,44,14,(from) the way?
10703,4,45,1,And Allah
10704,4,45,2,knows better
10705,4,45,3,about your enemies
10706,4,45,4,and (is) sufficient
10707,4,45,5,Allah
10708,4,45,6,"(as) a Protector,"
10709,4,45,7,and sufficient
10710,4,45,8,(is) Allah
10711,4,45,9,(as) a Helper.
10712,4,46,1,Of
10713,4,46,2,those who
10714,4,46,3,"are Jews,"
10715,4,46,4,they distort

10730,4,46,19,the religion.

10750,4,47,1,O you

10792,4,48,15,associates partners

11625,4,91,1,You will find

11637,4,91,13,they are plunged
11638,4,91,14,into it.
11639,4,91,15,So if
11640,4,91,16,not
11641,4,91,17,they withdraw from you

11643,4,91,19,to you
11644,4,91,20,[the] peace
11645,4,91,21,and they restrain
11646,4,91,22,"their hands,"
11647,4,91,23,then seize them
11648,4,91,24,and kill them
11649,4,91,25,wherever
11650,4,91,26,you find them.
11651,4,91,27,And those -

11657,4,92,1,And not
11658,4,92,2,is
11659,4,92,3,for a believer
11660,4,92,4,that
11661,4,92,5,he kills

13287,4,173,16,(with) a punishment
13288,4,173,17,"painful,"
13289,4,173,18,and not

13291,4,173,20,for themselves
13292,4,173,21,from
13293,4,173,22,besides

13298,4,174,1,O
13299,4,174,2,mankind!
13300,4,174,3,Surely
13301,4,174,4,has come to you
13302,4,174,5,a convincing proof

13313,4,175,5,and held fast
13314,4,175,6,"to Him,"
13315,4,175,7,then He will admit them
13316,4,175,8,in

13318,4,175,10,from Himself
13319,4,175,11,and Bounty

13321,4,175,13,to Himself
13322,4,175,14,"(on) a way,"
13323,4,175,15,straight.
13324,4,176,1,They seek your ruling.
13325,4,176,2,"Say,"

13353,4,176,30,two thirds
13354,4,176,31,of what

14141,5,29,12,(is the) recompense
14142,5,29,13,"(of) the wrong-doers."""
14143,5,30,1,Then prompted
14144,5,30,2,to him
14145,5,30,3,his soul
14146,5,30,4,(to) kill
14147,5,30,5,"his brother,"
14148,5,30,6,so he killed him
14149,5,30,7,and became
14150,5,30,8,of
14151,5,30,9,the losers.
14152,5,31,1,Then (was) sent
14153,5,31,2,(by) Allah
14154,5,31,3,"a crow,"
14155,5,31,4,it (was) scratching
14156,5,31,5,in
14157,5,31,6,the earth

14159,5,31,8,how
14160,5,31,9,to hide
14161,5,31,10,(the) dead body
14162,5,31,11,(of) his brother.
14163,5,31,12,"He said,"

14178,5,32,2,time

14299,5,36,23,(is) a punishment
14300,5,36,24,painful.
14301,5,37,1,They will wish
14302,5,37,2,that
14303,5,37,3,they come out

14352,5,40,13,[to] whom

14443,5,42,18,And if

14448,5,42,23,"Indeed,"
14449,5,42,24,Allah
14450,5,42,25,loves

14459,5,43,8,Then
14460,5,43,9,they turn away

14464,5,43,13,and not

14475,5,44,9,"the Prophets,"
14476,5,44,10,those who
14477,5,44,11,had submitted (to Allah)
14478,5,44,12,for those who
14479,5,44,13,"were Jews,"
14480,5,44,14,"and the Rabbis,"
14481,5,44,15,"and the scholars,"
14482,5,44,16,with what
14483,5,44,17,they were entrusted
14484,5,44,18,of
14485,5,44,19,(the) Book
14486,5,44,20,(of) Allah
14487,5,44,21,and they were
14488,5,44,22,to it

14500,5,44,34,(does) not
14501,5,44,35,judge
14502,5,44,36,by what
14503,5,44,37,has revealed

14505,5,44,39,then those
14506,5,44,40,[they]
14507,5,44,41,(are) the disbelievers.
14508,5,45,1,And We ordained

14510,5,45,3,in it
14511,5,45,4,that -
14512,5,45,5,the life
14513,5,45,6,"for the life,"
14514,5,45,7,and the eye
14515,5,45,8,"for the eye,"
14516,5,45,9,and the nose
14517,5,45,10,"for the nose,"
14518,5,45,11,and the ear
14519,5,45,12,"for the ear,"
14520,5,45,13,and the tooth
14521,5,45,14,"for the tooth,"
14522,5,45,15,and (for) wounds
14523,5,45,16,(is) retribution.
14524,5,45,17,But whoever
14525,5,45,18,gives charity
14526,5,45,19,"with it,"
14527,5,45,20,then it is
14528,5,45,21,an expiation
14529,5,45,22,for him.
14530,5,45,23,And whoever
14531,5,45,24,(does) not
14532,5,45,25,judge

14536,5,45,29,then those
14537,5,45,30,[they]
14538,5,45,31,(are) the wrongdoers.
14539,5,46,1,And We sent
14540,5,46,2,on
14541,5,46,3,their footsteps
14542,5,46,4,"Isa,"

14557,5,46,19,what
14558,5,46,20,(was) between

15407,5,87,13,"Indeed,"
15408,5,87,14,Allah
15409,5,87,15,(does) not
15410,5,87,16,love
15411,5,87,17,the transgressors.
15412,5,88,1,And eat

15416,5,88,5,lawful

15424,5,89,1,Not
15425,5,89,2,will call you to account
15426,5,89,3,Allah
15427,5,89,4,for the thoughtless utterances

15431,5,89,8,He will call you to account

15433,5,89,10,you contracted
15434,5,89,11,(of) the oath.
15435,5,89,12,So its expiation
15436,5,89,13,(is) feeding
15437,5,89,14,(of) ten

15455,5,89,32,That
15456,5,89,33,(is the) expiation

15462,5,89,39,Thus
15463,5,89,40,makes clear

22846,8,22,1,"Indeed,"
22847,8,22,2,worst
22848,8,22,3,(of) the living creatures
22849,8,22,4,near
22850,8,22,5,Allah
22851,8,22,6,"(are) the deaf,"
22852,8,22,7,the dumb -
22853,8,22,8,those who
22854,8,22,9,(do) not
22855,8,22,10,use (their) intellect.
22856,8,23,1,And if
22857,8,23,2,(had) known
22858,8,23,3,Allah
22859,8,23,4,in them
22860,8,23,5,"any good,"
22861,8,23,6,"surely, He (would) have made them hear."
22862,8,23,7,And if
22863,8,23,8,"He had made them hear,"
22864,8,23,9,"surely they would have turned away,"
22865,8,23,10,while they
22866,8,23,11,(were) averse.
22867,8,24,1,O you
22868,8,24,2,who
22869,8,24,3,believe!
22870,8,24,4,Respond
22871,8,24,5,to Allah
22872,8,24,6,and His Messenger
22873,8,24,7,when
22874,8,24,8,he calls you
22875,8,24,9,to what
22876,8,24,10,gives you life.
22877,8,24,11,And know
22878,8,24,12,that
22879,8,24,13,Allah
22880,8,24,14,comes
22881,8,24,15,(in) between
22882,8,24,16,a man
22883,8,24,17,"and his heart,"
22884,8,24,18,and that
22885,8,24,19,to Him
22886,8,24,20,you will be gathered.
22887,8,25,1,And fear
22888,8,25,2,a trial
22889,8,25,3,not
22890,8,25,4,which will afflict
22891,8,25,5,those who
22892,8,25,6,do wrong
22893,8,25,7,among you
22894,8,25,8,exclusively.
22895,8,25,9,And know
22896,8,25,10,that
22897,8,25,11,Allah
22898,8,25,12,(is) severe
22899,8,25,13,(in) the penalty.
22900,8,26,1,And remember
22901,8,26,2,when
22902,8,26,3,you
22903,8,26,4,(were) few
22904,8,26,5,(and) deemed weak
22905,8,26,6,in
22906,8,26,7,the earth
22907,8,26,8,fearing
22908,8,26,9,that
22909,8,26,10,might do away with you
22910,8,26,11,"the men,"
22911,8,26,12,"then He sheltered you,"
22912,8,26,13,and strengthened you
22913,8,26,14,"with His help,"
22914,8,26,15,and provided you
22915,8,26,16,of
22916,8,26,17,the good things
22917,8,26,18,so that you may
22918,8,26,19,(be) thankful.
22919,8,27,1,O you
22920,8,27,2,who
22921,8,27,3,believe!
22922,8,27,4,(Do) not
22923,8,27,5,betray
22924,8,27,6,Allah
22925,8,27,7,"and the Messenger,"
22926,8,27,8,or betray
22927,8,27,9,your trusts
22928,8,27,10,while you
22929,8,27,11,know.
22930,8,28,1,And know
22931,8,28,2,that
22932,8,28,3,your wealth
22933,8,28,4,and your children
22934,8,28,5,(are) a trial.
22935,8,28,6,And that
22936,8,28,7,Allah -
22937,8,28,8,with Him
22938,8,28,9,(is) a reward
22939,8,28,10,great.
22940,8,29,1,O you
22941,8,29,2,who
22942,8,29,3,believe!
22943,8,29,4,If
22944,8,29,5,you fear
22945,8,29,6,"Allah,"
22946,8,29,7,He will grant
22947,8,29,8,you
22948,8,29,9,a criterion
22949,8,29,10,and will remove
22950,8,29,11,from you
22951,8,29,12,your evil deeds
22952,8,29,13,and forgive
22953,8,29,14,you.
22954,8,29,15,And Allah
22955,8,29,16,(is) the Possessor
22956,8,29,17,"(of) Bounty,"
22957,8,29,18,the Great.
22958,8,30,1,And when
22959,8,30,2,plotted
22960,8,30,3,against you
22961,8,30,4,those who
22962,8,30,5,disbelieved
22963,8,30,6,that they restrain you
22964,8,30,7,or
22965,8,30,8,kill you
22966,8,30,9,or
22967,8,30,10,drive you out.
22968,8,30,11,And they were planning
22969,8,30,12,and (also) was planning
22970,8,30,13,Allah.
22971,8,30,14,And Allah
22972,8,30,15,is (the) Best
22973,8,30,16,(of) the Planners.
22974,8,31,1,And when
22975,8,31,2,are recited
22976,8,31,3,to them

23015,8,33,6,"(are) among them,"
23016,8,33,7,and not
23017,8,33,8,is
23018,8,33,9,Allah
23019,8,33,10,the One Who punishes them
23020,8,33,11,while they
23021,8,33,12,seek forgiveness.
23022,8,34,1,But what

23024,8,34,3,that not

23096,8,38,2,to those who
23097,8,38,3,disbelieve
23098,8,38,4,if
23099,8,38,5,they cease
23100,8,38,6,will be forgiven
23101,8,38,7,for them
23102,8,38,8,what
23103,8,38,9,[verily]
23104,8,38,10,(is) past.
23105,8,38,11,But if
23106,8,38,12,they return

23109,8,38,15,(the) practice

23114,8,39,4,there is
23115,8,39,5,oppression

23117,8,39,7,the religion
23118,8,39,8,all of it
23119,8,39,9,for Allah.
23120,8,39,10,But if
23121,8,39,11,"they cease,"
23122,8,39,12,"then indeed,"
23123,8,39,13,Allah

23130,8,40,4,that
23131,8,40,5,Allah

23133,8,40,7,Excellent
23134,8,40,8,"(is) the Protector,"
23135,8,40,9,and Excellent
23136,8,40,10,(is) the Helper.
23137,8,41,1,And know
23138,8,41,2,that what
23139,8,41,3,you obtain (as) spoils of war
23140,8,41,4,of
23141,8,41,5,"anything,"
23142,8,41,6,"then that,"
23143,8,41,7,for Allah
23144,8,41,8,(is) one fifth of it
23145,8,41,9,and for the Messenger
23146,8,41,10,and for the
23147,8,41,11,"near relatives,"

23149,8,41,13,and the needy
23150,8,41,14,and the
23151,8,41,15,"wayfarer,"
23152,8,41,16,if
23153,8,41,17,you
23154,8,41,18,believe
23155,8,41,19,"in Allah,"
23156,8,41,20,and (in) what
23157,8,41,21,We sent down
23158,8,41,22,to
23159,8,41,23,Our slave
23160,8,41,24,(on the) day
23161,8,41,25,"(of) the criterion,"
23162,8,41,26,(the) day
23163,8,41,27,(when) met
23164,8,41,28,the two forces.
23165,8,41,29,And Allah
23166,8,41,30,(is) on
23167,8,41,31,every
23168,8,41,32,thing
23169,8,41,33,All-Powerful.
23170,8,42,1,When
23171,8,42,2,you (were)
23172,8,42,3,"on side of the valley,"
23173,8,42,4,the nearer
23174,8,42,5,and they
23175,8,42,6,"(were) on the side,"
23176,8,42,7,the farther
23177,8,42,8,and the caravan
23178,8,42,9,(was) lower
23179,8,42,10,than you.
23180,8,42,11,And if
23181,8,42,12,you (had) made an appointment
23182,8,42,13,certainly you would have failed
23183,8,42,14,in
23184,8,42,15,the appointment.
23185,8,42,16,But
23186,8,42,17,that might accomplish
23187,8,42,18,Allah
23188,8,42,19,a matter
23189,8,42,20,(that) was
23190,8,42,21,"destined,"
23191,8,42,22,that (might be) destroyed
23192,8,42,23,(those) who
23193,8,42,24,(were to be) destroyed
23194,8,42,25,on
23195,8,42,26,a clear evidence
23196,8,42,27,and (might) live
23197,8,42,28,(those) who
23198,8,42,29,(were to) live
23199,8,42,30,on
23200,8,42,31,a clear evidence.
23201,8,42,32,"And indeed,"
23202,8,42,33,Allah
23203,8,42,34,"(is) All-Hearing,"
23204,8,42,35,All-Knowing.
23205,8,43,1,When
23206,8,43,2,you (where) shown them
23207,8,43,3,(by) Allah
23208,8,43,4,in
23209,8,43,5,your dream
23210,8,43,6,"(as) few,"
23211,8,43,7,and if
23212,8,43,8,He had shown them to you
23213,8,43,9,(as) many
23214,8,43,10,surely you would have lost courage
23215,8,43,11,and surely you would have disputed
23216,8,43,12,in
23217,8,43,13,"the matter,"
23218,8,43,14,but
23219,8,43,15,Allah
23220,8,43,16,saved (you).
23221,8,43,17,"Indeed, He"
23222,8,43,18,(is) All-Knower
23223,8,43,19,of what is in
23224,8,43,20,the breasts.
23225,8,44,1,And when
23226,8,44,2,"He showed them to you,"
23227,8,44,3,when
23228,8,44,4,you met -
23229,8,44,5,in
23230,8,44,6,your eyes
23231,8,44,7,(as) few
23232,8,44,8,and He made you (appear) as few
23233,8,44,9,in
23234,8,44,10,their eyes
23235,8,44,11,that might accomplish
23236,8,44,12,Allah might accomplish
23237,8,44,13,a matter
23238,8,44,14,(that) was
23239,8,44,15,(already) destined.
23240,8,44,16,And to
23241,8,44,17,Allah
23242,8,44,18,return
23243,8,44,19,(all) the matters.
23244,8,45,1,O you
23245,8,45,2,who
23246,8,45,3,believe!
23247,8,45,4,When
23248,8,45,5,you meet
23249,8,45,6,"a force,"
23250,8,45,7,then be firm
23251,8,45,8,and remember
23252,8,45,9,Allah
23253,8,45,10,"much,"
23254,8,45,11,so that you may
23255,8,45,12,(be) successful.
23256,8,46,1,And obey
23257,8,46,2,Allah
23258,8,46,3,"and His Messenger,"
23259,8,46,4,and (do) not
23260,8,46,5,dispute
23261,8,46,6,lest you lose courage
23262,8,46,7,and (would) depart
23263,8,46,8,"your strength,"
23264,8,46,9,and be patient.
23265,8,46,10,"Indeed,"
23266,8,46,11,Allah
23267,8,46,12,(is) with

23693,8,72,11,and those who
23694,8,72,12,gave shelter
23695,8,72,13,and helped
23696,8,72,14,those -
23697,8,72,15,some of them
23698,8,72,16,(are) allies
23699,8,72,17,(of) another.
23700,8,72,18,But those who
23701,8,72,19,believed
23702,8,72,20,and (did) not
23703,8,72,21,"emigrate,"
23704,8,72,22,(it is) not
23705,8,72,23,for you
23706,8,72,24,(of)
23707,8,72,25,their protection
23708,8,72,26,(in)
23709,8,72,27,"(in) anything,"
23710,8,72,28,until
23711,8,72,29,they emigrate.
23712,8,72,30,And if
23713,8,72,31,they seek your help
23714,8,72,32,in
23715,8,72,33,"the religion,"
23716,8,72,34,then upon you
23717,8,72,35,(is to) help them
23718,8,72,36,except
23719,8,72,37,against
23720,8,72,38,a people
23721,8,72,39,between you
23722,8,72,40,and between them
23723,8,72,41,(is) a treaty.
23724,8,72,42,And Allah
23725,8,72,43,of what
23726,8,72,44,you do
23727,8,72,45,(is) All-Seer.
23728,8,73,1,And those who
23729,8,73,2,"disbelieve,"
23730,8,73,3,some of them
23731,8,73,4,(are) allies
23732,8,73,5,(to) another.
23733,8,73,6,If not
23734,8,73,7,"you do it,"
23735,8,73,8,(there) will be
23736,8,73,9,oppression
23737,8,73,10,in
23738,8,73,11,the earth
23739,8,73,12,and corruption
23740,8,73,13,great.
23741,8,74,1,And those who
23742,8,74,2,believed
23743,8,74,3,and emigrated
23744,8,74,4,and strove hard
23745,8,74,5,in
23746,8,74,6,(the) way
23747,8,74,7,(of) Allah
23748,8,74,8,and those who
23749,8,74,9,gave shelter
23750,8,74,10,"and helped,"
23751,8,74,11,those -
23752,8,74,12,they (are)
23753,8,74,13,the believers
23754,8,74,14,(in) truth.
23755,8,74,15,For them
23756,8,74,16,(is) forgiveness
23757,8,74,17,and a provision
23758,8,74,18,noble.
23759,8,75,1,And those who
23760,8,75,2,believed
23761,8,75,3,from
23762,8,75,4,"afterwards,"
23763,8,75,5,and emigrated
23764,8,75,6,and strove hard
23765,8,75,7,"with you,"
23766,8,75,8,then those
23767,8,75,9,(are) of you.
23768,8,75,10,But those
23769,8,75,11,"(of) blood relationship,"
23770,8,75,12,some of them
23771,8,75,13,(are) nearer
23772,8,75,14,to another
23773,8,75,15,in
23774,8,75,16,(the) Book
23775,8,75,17,(of) Allah.
23776,8,75,18,"Indeed,"
23777,8,75,19,Allah
23778,8,75,20,of every
23779,8,75,21,thing
23780,8,75,22,(is) All-Knower.
23781,9,1,1,"[This is a declaration of] disassociation,"
23782,9,1,2,from
23783,9,1,3,Allah
23784,9,1,4,and His Messenger
23785,9,1,5,to
23786,9,1,6,those (with) whom
23787,9,1,7,you made a covenant
23788,9,1,8,from
23789,9,1,9,the polytheists.
23790,9,2,1,So move about
23791,9,2,2,in
23792,9,2,3,the land
23793,9,2,4,(during) four
23794,9,2,5,months
23795,9,2,6,but know
23796,9,2,7,that you
23797,9,2,8,(can) not
23798,9,2,9,escape
23799,9,2,10,Allah
23800,9,2,11,and that
23801,9,2,12,Allah
23802,9,2,13,(is) the One Who (will) disgrace
23803,9,2,14,the disbelievers.
23804,9,3,1,And an announcement
23805,9,3,2,from
23806,9,3,3,Allah
23807,9,3,4,and His Messenger
23808,9,3,5,to
23809,9,3,6,the people
23810,9,3,7,(on the) day
23811,9,3,8,"(of) the Pilgrimage,"
23812,9,3,9,"the greater,"
23813,9,3,10,that
23814,9,3,11,Allah
23815,9,3,12,(is) free from obligations
23816,9,3,13,[of]
23817,9,3,14,"(to) the polytheists,"
23818,9,3,15,and (so is) His Messenger.
23819,9,3,16,So if
23820,9,3,17,"you repent,"
23821,9,3,18,"then, it is"
23822,9,3,19,best
23823,9,3,20,for you.
23824,9,3,21,But if
23825,9,3,22,you turn away
23826,9,3,23,then know
23827,9,3,24,that you
23828,9,3,25,(can) not
23829,9,3,26,escape
23830,9,3,27,Allah.
23831,9,3,28,And give glad tidings
23832,9,3,29,(to) those who
23833,9,3,30,disbelieve
23834,9,3,31,of a punishment
23835,9,3,32,painful.
23836,9,4,1,Except
23837,9,4,2,those (with) whom
23838,9,4,3,you have a covenant
23839,9,4,4,among
23840,9,4,5,"the polytheists,"
23841,9,4,6,then
23842,9,4,7,not
23843,9,4,8,they have failed you
23844,9,4,9,(in any) thing
23845,9,4,10,and not
23846,9,4,11,they have supported
23847,9,4,12,against you
23848,9,4,13,"anyone,"
23849,9,4,14,so fulfil
23850,9,4,15,to them
23851,9,4,16,their treaty
23852,9,4,17,till
23853,9,4,18,their term.
23854,9,4,19,"Indeed,"
23855,9,4,20,Allah
23856,9,4,21,loves
23857,9,4,22,the righteous.
23858,9,5,1,Then when
23859,9,5,2,have passed
23860,9,5,3,"the months,"
23861,9,5,4,"the sacred,"
23862,9,5,5,then kill
23863,9,5,6,the polytheists
23864,9,5,7,wherever
23865,9,5,8,you find them
23866,9,5,9,and seize them
23867,9,5,10,and besiege them
23868,9,5,11,and sit (in wait)
23869,9,5,12,for them
23870,9,5,13,(at) every
23871,9,5,14,place of ambush.
23872,9,5,15,But if
23873,9,5,16,they repent
23874,9,5,17,and establish
23875,9,5,18,the prayer
23876,9,5,19,and give
23877,9,5,20,the zakah
23878,9,5,21,then leave
23879,9,5,22,their way.
23880,9,5,23,"Indeed,"
23881,9,5,24,Allah
23882,9,5,25,"(is) Oft-Forgiving,"
23883,9,5,26,Most Merciful.
23884,9,6,1,And if
23885,9,6,2,anyone
23886,9,6,3,of
23887,9,6,4,the polytheists
23888,9,6,5,seek your protection
23889,9,6,6,then grant him protection
23890,9,6,7,until
23891,9,6,8,he hears
23892,9,6,9,(the) Words
23893,9,6,10,(of) Allah.
23894,9,6,11,Then
23895,9,6,12,escort him
23896,9,6,13,(to) his place of safety.
23897,9,6,14,That
23898,9,6,15,(is) because they
23899,9,6,16,(are) a people
23900,9,6,17,(who do) not
23901,9,6,18,know.
23902,9,7,1,How
23903,9,7,2,can (there) be
23904,9,7,3,for the polytheists
23905,9,7,4,a covenant
23906,9,7,5,with
23907,9,7,6,Allah
23908,9,7,7,and with
23909,9,7,8,"His Messenger,"
23910,9,7,9,except
23911,9,7,10,those (with) whom
23912,9,7,11,you made a covenant
23913,9,7,12,near
23914,9,7,13,Al-Masjid
23915,9,7,14,Al-Haraam?
23916,9,7,15,So long as
23917,9,7,16,they are upright
23918,9,7,17,to you
23919,9,7,18,then you be upright
23920,9,7,19,to them.
23921,9,7,20,"Indeed,"
23922,9,7,21,Allah
23923,9,7,22,loves
23924,9,7,23,the righteous.
23925,9,8,1,How
23926,9,8,2,"while, if"
23927,9,8,3,they gain dominance
23928,9,8,4,over you
23929,9,8,5,not
23930,9,8,6,do they regard (the ties)
23931,9,8,7,with you
23932,9,8,8,(of) kinship
23933,9,8,9,and not
23934,9,8,10,covenant of protection?
23935,9,8,11,They satisfy you
23936,9,8,12,with their mouths
23937,9,8,13,"but refuse,"
23938,9,8,14,their hearts
23939,9,8,15,and most of them
23940,9,8,16,(are) defiantly disobedient.
23941,9,9,1,They exchange
23942,9,9,2,[with] the Verses
23943,9,9,3,(of) Allah
23944,9,9,4,"(for) a price,"
23945,9,9,5,"little,"
23946,9,9,6,and they hinder (people)
23947,9,9,7,from
23948,9,9,8,His way.
23949,9,9,9,"Indeed,"
23950,9,9,10,evil
23951,9,9,11,(is) what
23952,9,9,12,they used to
23953,9,9,13,do.
23954,9,10,1,Not
23955,9,10,2,they respect (the ties)
23956,9,10,3,towards
23957,9,10,4,a believer
23958,9,10,5,(of) kinship
23959,9,10,6,and not
23960,9,10,7,covenant of protection.
23961,9,10,8,And those
23962,9,10,9,[they]
23963,9,10,10,(are) the transgressors.
23964,9,11,1,But if
23965,9,11,2,they repent
23966,9,11,3,and establish
23967,9,11,4,the prayer
23968,9,11,5,and give
23969,9,11,6,"the zakah,"
23970,9,11,7,then (they are) your brothers
23971,9,11,8,in
23972,9,11,9,[the] religion.
23973,9,11,10,And We explain in detail
23974,9,11,11,the Verses
23975,9,11,12,for a people
23976,9,11,13,(who) know.
23977,9,12,1,And if
23978,9,12,2,they break
23979,9,12,3,their oaths
23980,9,12,4,from
23981,9,12,5,after
23982,9,12,6,their treaty
23983,9,12,7,and defame
23984,9,12,8,[in]
23985,9,12,9,"your religion,"
23986,9,12,10,then fight
23987,9,12,11,the leaders
23988,9,12,12,"(of) [the] disbelief,"
23989,9,12,13,"indeed, they -"
23990,9,12,14,no
23991,9,12,15,oaths
23992,9,12,16,"for them,"
23993,9,12,17,so that they may
23994,9,12,18,cease.
23995,9,13,1,Will not
23996,9,13,2,you fight
23997,9,13,3,a people
23998,9,13,4,who broke
23999,9,13,5,their oaths
24000,9,13,6,and determined
24001,9,13,7,to drive out
24002,9,13,8,the Messenger
24003,9,13,9,and they
24004,9,13,10,began (to attack) you
24005,9,13,11,first
24006,9,13,12,time?
24007,9,13,13,Do you fear them?
24008,9,13,14,But Allah
24009,9,13,15,(has) more right
24010,9,13,16,that
24011,9,13,17,"you should fear Him,"
24012,9,13,18,if
24013,9,13,19,you are
24014,9,13,20,believers.
24015,9,14,1,Fight them -
24016,9,14,2,will punish them
24017,9,14,3,Allah
24018,9,14,4,by your hands
24019,9,14,5,and disgrace them
24020,9,14,6,and give you victory
24021,9,14,7,"over them,"
24022,9,14,8,and will heal
24023,9,14,9,(the) breasts
24024,9,14,10,(of) a people
24025,9,14,11,(who are) believers.
24026,9,15,1,And remove
24027,9,15,2,(the) anger
24028,9,15,3,(of) their hearts.
24029,9,15,4,And accepts repentance
24030,9,15,5,(does) Allah
24031,9,15,6,of
24032,9,15,7,whom
24033,9,15,8,He wills.
24034,9,15,9,And Allah
24035,9,15,10,"(is) All-Knower,"
24036,9,15,11,All-Wise.
24037,9,16,1,Or
24038,9,16,2,(do) you think
24039,9,16,3,that
24040,9,16,4,you would be left
24041,9,16,5,while not
24042,9,16,6,(were) made evident
24043,9,16,7,(by) Allah
24044,9,16,8,those who
24045,9,16,9,strive
24046,9,16,10,"among you,"
24047,9,16,11,and not
24048,9,16,12,take
24049,9,16,13,from
24050,9,16,14,besides
24051,9,16,15,Allah
24052,9,16,16,and not
24053,9,16,17,His Messenger
24054,9,16,18,and not
24055,9,16,19,the believers
24056,9,16,20,(as) intimates?
24057,9,16,21,And Allah
24058,9,16,22,(is) All-Aware
24059,9,16,23,of what
24060,9,16,24,you do.
24061,9,17,1,Not
24062,9,17,2,is (it)
24063,9,17,3,for the polytheists
24064,9,17,4,that
24065,9,17,5,they maintain
24066,9,17,6,(the) masajid
24067,9,17,7,(of) Allah
24068,9,17,8,(while) witnessing
24069,9,17,9,against
24070,9,17,10,themselves
24071,9,17,11,[with] disbelief.
24072,9,17,12,"(For) those,"
24073,9,17,13,worthless
24074,9,17,14,"(are) their deeds,"
24075,9,17,15,and in
24076,9,17,16,the Fire
24077,9,17,17,they
24078,9,17,18,(will) abide forever.
24079,9,18,1,Only
24080,9,18,2,will maintain
24081,9,18,3,(the) masajid
24082,9,18,4,(of) Allah
24083,9,18,5,(the one) who
24084,9,18,6,believes
24085,9,18,7,in Allah
24086,9,18,8,and the Day
24087,9,18,9,"the Last,"
24088,9,18,10,and establishes
24089,9,18,11,the prayer
24090,9,18,12,and gives
24091,9,18,13,the zakah
24092,9,18,14,and not
24093,9,18,15,fear
24094,9,18,16,except
24095,9,18,17,Allah.
24096,9,18,18,Then perhaps
24097,9,18,19,"those,"
24098,9,18,20,[that]
24099,9,18,21,they are
24100,9,18,22,of
24101,9,18,23,the guided ones.
24102,9,19,1,Do you make
24103,9,19,2,the providing of water
24104,9,19,3,(to) the pilgrims
24105,9,19,4,and (the) maintenance
24106,9,19,5,(of) Al-Masjid
24107,9,19,6,Al-Haraam
24108,9,19,7,like (the one) who
24109,9,19,8,believes
24110,9,19,9,in Allah
24111,9,19,10,and the Day
24112,9,19,11,"the Last,"
24113,9,19,12,and strives
24114,9,19,13,in
24115,9,19,14,(the) way
24116,9,19,15,(of) Allah?
24117,9,19,16,Not
24118,9,19,17,are they equal
24119,9,19,18,near
24120,9,19,19,Allah.

25163,9,73,3,Strive (against)

25165,9,73,5,and the hypocrites
25166,9,73,6,and be stern
25167,9,73,7,with them.
25168,9,73,8,And their abode
25169,9,73,9,"(is) Hell,"
25170,9,73,10,and wretched
25171,9,73,11,(is) the destination.
25172,9,74,1,They swear

25174,9,74,3,(that) nothing
25175,9,74,4,"they said,"
25176,9,74,5,while certainly

25187,9,74,16,And not

25250,9,77,12,"they had promised Him,"

34683,16,41,8,"they were wronged,"
34684,16,41,9,surely We will give them position

34686,16,41,11,the world
34687,16,41,12,"good,"

35087,16,71,7,[the] provision.
35088,16,71,8,But not
35089,16,71,9,those who
35090,16,71,10,were favored
35091,16,71,11,would hand over
35092,16,71,12,their provision
35093,16,71,13,to
35094,16,71,14,whom
35095,16,71,15,possess
35096,16,71,16,"their right hands,"
35097,16,71,17,so (that) they
35098,16,71,18,(are) in it
35099,16,71,19,equal.
35100,16,71,20,Then is it the Favor
35101,16,71,21,of Allah
35102,16,71,22,they reject?
35103,16,72,1,And Allah
35104,16,72,2,(has) made
35105,16,72,3,for you
35106,16,72,4,from
35107,16,72,5,yourselves
35108,16,72,6,"spouses,"
35109,16,72,7,and has made
35110,16,72,8,for you
35111,16,72,9,from
35112,16,72,10,your spouses
35113,16,72,11,sons
35114,16,72,12,and grandsons
35115,16,72,13,and has provided for you
35116,16,72,14,from
35117,16,72,15,the good things.
35118,16,72,16,Then in falsehood do
35119,16,72,17,"they believe,"
35120,16,72,18,and the Favor
35121,16,72,19,of Allah
35122,16,72,20,they
35123,16,72,21,disbelieve?
35124,16,73,1,And they worship
35125,16,73,2,(from)
35126,16,73,3,other than
35127,16,73,4,Allah
35128,16,73,5,which
35129,16,73,6,not
35130,16,73,7,possesses
35131,16,73,8,for them
35132,16,73,9,any provision
35133,16,73,10,from
35134,16,73,11,the heavens
35135,16,73,12,and the earth
35136,16,73,13,"[anything],"
35137,16,73,14,and not
35138,16,73,15,they are able.
35139,16,74,1,So (do) not
35140,16,74,2,put forth
35141,16,74,3,for Allah
35142,16,74,4,the similitude.
35143,16,74,5,"Indeed,"
35144,16,74,6,Allah
35145,16,74,7,knows
35146,16,74,8,and you
35147,16,74,9,(do) not
35148,16,74,10,know.
35149,16,75,1,Sets forth
35150,16,75,2,(does) Allah
35151,16,75,3,the example
35152,16,75,4,(of) a slave
35153,16,75,5,"(who is) owned,"
35154,16,75,6,not
35155,16,75,7,he has power
35156,16,75,8,on
35157,16,75,9,anything
35158,16,75,10,and (one) whom
35159,16,75,11,We provided him
35160,16,75,12,from Us
35161,16,75,13,a provision
35162,16,75,14,"good,"
35163,16,75,15,so he
35164,16,75,16,spends
35165,16,75,17,"from it,"
35166,16,75,18,secretly
35167,16,75,19,and publicly.
35168,16,75,20,Can
35169,16,75,21,they be equal?
35170,16,75,22,All praise
35171,16,75,23,(is) for Allah!
35172,16,75,24,"Nay,"
35173,16,75,25,but most of them
35174,16,75,26,(do) not
35175,16,75,27,know.
35176,16,76,1,And sets forth
35177,16,76,2,(does) Allah
35178,16,76,3,an example
35179,16,76,4,"(of) two men,"
35180,16,76,5,one of them
35181,16,76,6,"(is) dumb,"
35182,16,76,7,not
35183,16,76,8,he has power
35184,16,76,9,on
35185,16,76,10,"anything,"
35186,16,76,11,while he
35187,16,76,12,(is) a burden
35188,16,76,13,on
35189,16,76,14,his master.
35190,16,76,15,Wherever
35191,16,76,16,he directs him
35192,16,76,17,not
35193,16,76,18,he comes
35194,16,76,19,with any good.
35195,16,76,20,Is
35196,16,76,21,equal
35197,16,76,22,he
35198,16,76,23,and (the one) who
35199,16,76,24,commands
35200,16,76,25,"[of] justice,"
35201,16,76,26,and he
35202,16,76,27,(is) on
35203,16,76,28,a path
35204,16,76,29,straight?
35205,16,77,1,And to Allah (belongs)
35206,16,77,2,(the) unseen
35207,16,77,3,(of) the heavens
35208,16,77,4,and the earth.
35209,16,77,5,And not
35210,16,77,6,(is the) matter
35211,16,77,7,(of) the Hour
35212,16,77,8,but
35213,16,77,9,as a twinkling
35214,16,77,10,(of) the eye
35215,16,77,11,or
35216,16,77,12,it
35217,16,77,13,(is) nearer.
35218,16,77,14,"Indeed,"
35219,16,77,15,Allah
35220,16,77,16,on
35221,16,77,17,every
35222,16,77,18,thing
35223,16,77,19,(is) All-Powerful.
35224,16,78,1,And Allah
35225,16,78,2,brought you forth
35226,16,78,3,from
35227,16,78,4,the wombs
35228,16,78,5,"(of) your mothers,"
35229,16,78,6,not
35230,16,78,7,knowing
35231,16,78,8,"anything,"
35232,16,78,9,and made
35233,16,78,10,for you
35234,16,78,11,the hearing
35235,16,78,12,and the sight
35236,16,78,13,and the hearts
35237,16,78,14,so that you may
35238,16,78,15,give thanks.
35239,16,79,1,Do not
35240,16,79,2,they see
35241,16,79,3,towards
35242,16,79,4,the birds
35243,16,79,5,controlled
35244,16,79,6,in
35245,16,79,7,the midst
35246,16,79,8,(of) the sky?
35247,16,79,9,None
35248,16,79,10,holds them up
35249,16,79,11,except
35250,16,79,12,Allah.
35251,16,79,13,"Indeed,"
35252,16,79,14,in
35253,16,79,15,that
35254,16,79,16,(are) Signs
35255,16,79,17,for a people
35256,16,79,18,who believe.
35257,16,80,1,And Allah
35258,16,80,2,(has) made
35259,16,80,3,for you
35260,16,80,4,[from]
35261,16,80,5,your homes
35262,16,80,6,"a resting place,"
35263,16,80,7,and made
35264,16,80,8,for you
35265,16,80,9,from
35266,16,80,10,the hides
35267,16,80,11,(of) the cattle
35268,16,80,12,"tents,"
35269,16,80,13,which you find light
35270,16,80,14,(on) the day
35271,16,80,15,(of) your travel
35272,16,80,16,and the day
35273,16,80,17,(of) your encampment;
35274,16,80,18,and from
35275,16,80,19,their wool
35276,16,80,20,and their fur
35277,16,80,21,and their hair
35278,16,80,22,(is) furnishing
35279,16,80,23,and a provision
35280,16,80,24,for
35281,16,80,25,a time.
35282,16,81,1,And Allah
35283,16,81,2,(has) made
35284,16,81,3,for you
35285,16,81,4,from what
35286,16,81,5,"He created,"
35287,16,81,6,shades
35288,16,81,7,and (has) made
35289,16,81,8,for you
35290,16,81,9,from
35291,16,81,10,"the mountains,"
35292,16,81,11,shelters
35293,16,81,12,and (has) made
35294,16,81,13,for you
35295,16,81,14,garments
35296,16,81,15,to protect you
35297,16,81,16,(from) the heat
35298,16,81,17,and garments
35299,16,81,18,to protect you
35300,16,81,19,from your (mutual) violence.
35301,16,81,20,Thus
35302,16,81,21,He completes
35303,16,81,22,His Favor
35304,16,81,23,upon you
35305,16,81,24,so that you may
35306,16,81,25,submit.
35307,16,82,1,"Then, if"
35308,16,82,2,they turn away
35309,16,82,3,then only
35310,16,82,4,upon you
35311,16,82,5,(is) the conveyance
35312,16,82,6,the clear.
35313,16,83,1,They recognize
35314,16,83,2,(the) Favor
35315,16,83,3,(of) Allah;
35316,16,83,4,then
35317,16,83,5,they deny it.
35318,16,83,6,And most of them
35319,16,83,7,(are) the disbelievers.
35320,16,84,1,And the Day
35321,16,84,2,We will resurrect
35322,16,84,3,from
35323,16,84,4,every
35324,16,84,5,nation
35325,16,84,6,"a witness,"
35326,16,84,7,then
35327,16,84,8,not
35328,16,84,9,will be permitted
35329,16,84,10,to those who
35330,16,84,11,disbelieved
35331,16,84,12,and not
35332,16,84,13,they
35333,16,84,14,will be asked to make amends.
35334,16,85,1,And when
35335,16,85,2,(will) see
35336,16,85,3,those who
35337,16,85,4,wronged
35338,16,85,5,"the punishment,"
35339,16,85,6,then not
35340,16,85,7,it will be lightened
35341,16,85,8,for them
35342,16,85,9,and not
35343,16,85,10,they
35344,16,85,11,will be given respite.
35345,16,86,1,And when
35346,16,86,2,(will) see
35347,16,86,3,those who
35348,16,86,4,associated partners with Allah
35349,16,86,5,their partners.
35350,16,86,6,"They will say,"
35351,16,86,7,"""Our Lord,"
35352,16,86,8,these
35353,16,86,9,(are) our partners
35354,16,86,10,those whom
35355,16,86,11,we used to
35356,16,86,12,invoke
35357,16,86,13,(from)
35358,16,86,14,"besides You."""
35359,16,86,15,But they (will) throw back
35360,16,86,16,at them
35361,16,86,17,"(their) word,"
35362,16,86,18,"""Indeed, you"
35363,16,86,19,"(are) surely liars."""
35364,16,87,1,And they (will) offer
35365,16,87,2,to
35366,16,87,3,Allah
35367,16,87,4,(on) that Day
35368,16,87,5,"the submission,"
35369,16,87,6,and (is) lost
35370,16,87,7,from them
35371,16,87,8,what
35372,16,87,9,they used (to)
35373,16,87,10,invent.
35374,16,88,1,And those who
35375,16,88,2,disbelieved
35376,16,88,3,and hindered
35377,16,88,4,from
35378,16,88,5,(the) way
35379,16,88,6,"(of) Allah,"
35380,16,88,7,We will increase them
35381,16,88,8,(in) punishment
35382,16,88,9,over
35383,16,88,10,punishment
35384,16,88,11,because
35385,16,88,12,they used (to)
35386,16,88,13,spread corruption.
35387,16,89,1,And the Day
35388,16,89,2,We will resurrect
35389,16,89,3,among
35390,16,89,4,every
35391,16,89,5,nation
35392,16,89,6,a witness
35393,16,89,7,over them
35394,16,89,8,from
35395,16,89,9,themselves.
35396,16,89,10,And We (will) bring
35397,16,89,11,you
35398,16,89,12,(as) a witness
35399,16,89,13,over
35400,16,89,14,these.
35401,16,89,15,And We sent down
35402,16,89,16,to you
35403,16,89,17,the Book
35404,16,89,18,(as) a clarification
35405,16,89,19,of every
35406,16,89,20,thing
35407,16,89,21,and a guidance
35408,16,89,22,and mercy
35409,16,89,23,and glad tidings
35410,16,89,24,for the Muslims.
35411,16,90,1,"Indeed,"
35412,16,90,2,Allah
35413,16,90,3,commands
35414,16,90,4,justice
35415,16,90,5,"and the good,"
35416,16,90,6,and giving
35417,16,90,7,"(to) those,"
35418,16,90,8,"relatives,"
35419,16,90,9,and forbids
35420,16,90,10,[from]
35421,16,90,11,the immorality
35422,16,90,12,and the bad
35423,16,90,13,and the oppression.
35424,16,90,14,He admonishes you
35425,16,90,15,so that you may
35426,16,90,16,take heed.
35427,16,91,1,And fulfil
35428,16,91,2,the covenant
35429,16,91,3,(of) Allah
35430,16,91,4,when
35431,16,91,5,"you have taken a covenant,"
35432,16,91,6,and (do) not
35433,16,91,7,break
35434,16,91,8,oaths
35435,16,91,9,after
35436,16,91,10,their confirmation
35437,16,91,11,while verily
35438,16,91,12,you have made
35439,16,91,13,Allah
35440,16,91,14,over you
35441,16,91,15,a surety.
35442,16,91,16,"Indeed,"
35443,16,91,17,Allah
35444,16,91,18,knows
35445,16,91,19,what
35446,16,91,20,you do.
35447,16,92,1,And (do) not
35448,16,92,2,be
35449,16,92,3,like her who
35450,16,92,4,untwists
35451,16,92,5,her spun yarn
35452,16,92,6,(from)
35453,16,92,7,after
35454,16,92,8,strength
35455,16,92,9,(into) untwisted strands;
35456,16,92,10,you take
35457,16,92,11,your oaths
35458,16,92,12,(as) a deception
35459,16,92,13,"between you,"
35460,16,92,14,because
35461,16,92,15,is
35462,16,92,16,a community
35463,16,92,17,[it]
35464,16,92,18,more numerous
35465,16,92,19,than
35466,16,92,20,(another) community.
35467,16,92,21,"Only,"
35468,16,92,22,tests you
35469,16,92,23,Allah
35470,16,92,24,by it.
35471,16,92,25,And He will make clear
35472,16,92,26,to you
35473,16,92,27,(on) the Day
35474,16,92,28,"(of) the Resurrection,"
35475,16,92,29,what
35476,16,92,30,you used (to)
35477,16,92,31,in it
35478,16,92,32,differ.
35479,16,93,1,And if
35480,16,93,2,(had) willed
35481,16,93,3,Allah
35482,16,93,4,surely He (could) have made you
35483,16,93,5,a nation
35484,16,93,6,"one,"
35485,16,93,7,but
35486,16,93,8,He lets go astray
35487,16,93,9,whom
35488,16,93,10,He wills
35489,16,93,11,and guides

43919,23,12,1,"And indeed,"
43920,23,12,2,We created

43924,23,12,6,of
43925,23,12,7,clay.
43926,23,13,1,Then
43927,23,13,2,We placed him
43928,23,13,3,(as) a semen-drop

43930,23,13,5,a resting place
43931,23,13,6,firm.
43932,23,14,1,Then
43933,23,14,2,We created
43934,23,14,3,the semen-drop

43938,23,14,7,"(into) an embryonic lump,"
43939,23,14,8,then We created
43940,23,14,9,"the embryonic lump,"
43941,23,14,10,"(into) bones,"

52065,30,8,18,of
52066,30,8,19,the people
52067,30,8,20,in (the) meeting
52068,30,8,21,(with) their Lord
52069,30,8,22,surely (are) disbelievers.
52070,30,9,1,Have not
52071,30,9,2,they traveled
52072,30,9,3,in
52073,30,9,4,the earth
52074,30,9,5,and observed
52075,30,9,6,how
52076,30,9,7,was
52077,30,9,8,(the) end
52078,30,9,9,(of) those
52079,30,9,10,from
52080,30,9,11,before them?
52081,30,9,12,They were
52082,30,9,13,mightier
52083,30,9,14,than them
52084,30,9,15,"(in) strength,"
52085,30,9,16,and they dug
52086,30,9,17,the earth
52087,30,9,18,and built (on) it
52088,30,9,19,more
52089,30,9,20,than what
52090,30,9,21,they have built (on) it.
52091,30,9,22,And came (to) them
52092,30,9,23,their Messengers
52093,30,9,24,with clear proofs.
52094,30,9,25,So not
52095,30,9,26,was
52096,30,9,27,Allah
52097,30,9,28,to wrong them
52098,30,9,29,but
52099,30,9,30,they were
52100,30,9,31,themselves
52101,30,9,32,(doing) wrong.
52102,30,10,1,Then
52103,30,10,2,was
52104,30,10,3,(the) end
52105,30,10,4,(of) those who
52106,30,10,5,did evil -
52107,30,10,6,"the evil,"
52108,30,10,7,because
52109,30,10,8,they denied
52110,30,10,9,(the) Signs
52111,30,10,10,(of) Allah
52112,30,10,11,and were
52113,30,10,12,of them
52114,30,10,13,making mockery.
52115,30,11,1,Allah
52116,30,11,2,originates
52117,30,11,3,"the creation,"
52118,30,11,4,then
52119,30,11,5,"He repeats it,"
52120,30,11,6,then
52121,30,11,7,to Him
52122,30,11,8,you will be returned.
52123,30,12,1,And (the) Day
52124,30,12,2,will (be) established
52125,30,12,3,"the Hour,"
52126,30,12,4,will (be in) despair
52127,30,12,5,the criminals.
52128,30,13,1,And not
52129,30,13,2,will be
52130,30,13,3,for them
52131,30,13,4,among
52132,30,13,5,theirs partners
52133,30,13,6,any intercessors
52134,30,13,7,and they will be
52135,30,13,8,in their partners
52136,30,13,9,disbelievers.
52137,30,14,1,And (the) Day
52138,30,14,2,will (be) established
52139,30,14,3,"the Hour,"
52140,30,14,4,that Day
52141,30,14,5,they will become separated.
52142,30,15,1,Then as for
52143,30,15,2,those who
52144,30,15,3,believed
52145,30,15,4,and did
52146,30,15,5,"righteous deeds,"
52147,30,15,6,so they
52148,30,15,7,in
52149,30,15,8,a Garden
52150,30,15,9,will be delighted.
52151,30,16,1,But as for
52152,30,16,2,those who
52153,30,16,3,disbelieved
52154,30,16,4,and denied
52155,30,16,5,Our Signs
52156,30,16,6,and (the) meeting
52157,30,16,7,"(of) the Hereafter,"
52158,30,16,8,then those
52159,30,16,9,in
52160,30,16,10,the punishment
52161,30,16,11,(will be) brought forth.
52162,30,17,1,So glory be to
52163,30,17,2,Allah
52164,30,17,3,when
52165,30,17,4,you reach the evening
52166,30,17,5,and when
52167,30,17,6,you reach the morning.
52168,30,18,1,And for Him
52169,30,18,2,(are) all praises
52170,30,18,3,in
52171,30,18,4,the heavens
52172,30,18,5,and the earth
52173,30,18,6,and (at) night
52174,30,18,7,and when
52175,30,18,8,you are at noon.
52176,30,19,1,He brings forth
52177,30,19,2,the living
52178,30,19,3,from
52179,30,19,4,the dead
52180,30,19,5,and He brings forth
52181,30,19,6,the dead
52182,30,19,7,from
52183,30,19,8,"the living,"
52184,30,19,9,and He gives life
52185,30,19,10,(to) the earth
52186,30,19,11,after
52187,30,19,12,"its death,"
52188,30,19,13,and thus
52189,30,19,14,you will be brought forth.
52190,30,20,1,And among
52191,30,20,2,His Signs
52192,30,20,3,(is) that
52193,30,20,4,He created you
52194,30,20,5,from
52195,30,20,6,dust
52196,30,20,7,then
52197,30,20,8,behold!
52198,30,20,9,You
52199,30,20,10,(are) human beings
52200,30,20,11,dispersing.

52207,30,21,7,yourselves
52208,30,21,8,mates
52209,30,21,9,that you may find tranquility
52210,30,21,10,in them;
52211,30,21,11,and He placed
52212,30,21,12,between you
52213,30,21,13,love
52214,30,21,14,and mercy.
52215,30,21,15,"Indeed,"
52216,30,21,16,in
52217,30,21,17,that
52218,30,21,18,surely (are) Signs

52236,30,23,3,(is) your sleep
52237,30,23,4,by night
52238,30,23,5,and the day
52239,30,23,6,[and] your seeking
52240,30,23,7,of
52241,30,23,8,His Bounty.
52242,30,23,9,"Indeed,"

52246,30,23,13,for a people
52247,30,23,14,who listen.
52248,30,24,1,And among

52250,30,24,3,He shows you
52251,30,24,4,the lightning
52252,30,24,5,(causing) fear
52253,30,24,6,"and hope,"
52254,30,24,7,and He sends down
52255,30,24,8,from
52256,30,24,9,the sky
52257,30,24,10,water
52258,30,24,11,and gives life
52259,30,24,12,therewith

52303,30,27,11,"(is) the description,"
52304,30,27,12,the highest

52310,30,27,18,the All-Wise.
52311,30,28,1,He sets forth
52312,30,28,2,to you
52313,30,28,3,an example
52314,30,28,4,from

52316,30,28,6,Is

52318,30,28,8,among

52321,30,28,11,your right hands
52322,30,28,12,any
52323,30,28,13,partners
52324,30,28,14,in
52325,30,28,15,what
52326,30,28,16,We have provided you
52327,30,28,17,so you
52328,30,28,18,in it
52329,30,28,19,"(are) equal,"
52330,30,28,20,you fear them
52331,30,28,21,as you fear
52332,30,28,22,yourselves?
52333,30,28,23,Thus
52334,30,28,24,We explain
52335,30,28,25,the Verses
52336,30,28,26,for a people
52337,30,28,27,(who) use reason.
52338,30,29,1,"Nay,"
52339,30,29,2,follow

52342,30,29,5,"their desires,"
52343,30,29,6,without
52344,30,29,7,knowledge.
52345,30,29,8,Then who
52346,30,29,9,(can) guide
52347,30,29,10,(one) whom
52348,30,29,11,has (been) let go astray
52349,30,29,12,(by) Allah?
52350,30,29,13,And not
52351,30,29,14,for them
52352,30,29,15,any
52353,30,29,16,helpers.
52354,30,30,1,So set
52355,30,30,2,your face
52356,30,30,3,to the religion
52357,30,30,4,upright.
52358,30,30,5,Nature
52359,30,30,6,(made by) Allah
52360,30,30,7,(upon) which
52361,30,30,8,He has created
52362,30,30,9,mankind
52363,30,30,10,[on it].
52364,30,30,11,No
52365,30,30,12,change
52366,30,30,13,(should there be) in the creation
52367,30,30,14,(of) Allah.
52368,30,30,15,That
52369,30,30,16,(is) the religion
52370,30,30,17,"the correct,"
52371,30,30,18,but
52372,30,30,19,most
52373,30,30,20,men
52374,30,30,21,(do) not
52375,30,30,22,know.
52376,30,31,1,Turning
52377,30,31,2,"to Him,"
52378,30,31,3,and fear Him
52379,30,31,4,and establish
52380,30,31,5,the prayer
52381,30,31,6,and (do) not
52382,30,31,7,be
52383,30,31,8,of
52384,30,31,9,the polytheists
52385,30,32,1,Of
52386,30,32,2,those who
52387,30,32,3,divide
52388,30,32,4,their religion
52389,30,32,5,and become
52390,30,32,6,"sects,"
52391,30,32,7,each
52392,30,32,8,party
52393,30,32,9,in what
52394,30,32,10,they have
52395,30,32,11,rejoicing.
52396,30,33,1,And when
52397,30,33,2,touches
52398,30,33,3,people
52399,30,33,4,"hardship,"
52400,30,33,5,they call
52401,30,33,6,their Lord
52402,30,33,7,turning
52403,30,33,8,to Him.
52404,30,33,9,Then
52405,30,33,10,when
52406,30,33,11,He causes them to taste
52407,30,33,12,from Him
52408,30,33,13,Mercy
52409,30,33,14,behold!
52410,30,33,15,A party
52411,30,33,16,of them
52412,30,33,17,with their Lord
52413,30,33,18,associate partners
52414,30,34,1,So as to deny
52415,30,34,2,"[in] what,"
52416,30,34,3,We have granted them.
52417,30,34,4,"Then enjoy,"
52418,30,34,5,but soon
52419,30,34,6,you will know.
52420,30,35,1,Or
52421,30,35,2,have We sent
52422,30,35,3,to them
52423,30,35,4,an authority
52424,30,35,5,and it
52425,30,35,6,speaks
52426,30,35,7,of what
52427,30,35,8,they were
52428,30,35,9,with Him
52429,30,35,10,associating?
52430,30,36,1,And when
52431,30,36,2,We cause to taste
52432,30,36,3,people
52433,30,36,4,"mercy,"
52434,30,36,5,they rejoice
52435,30,36,6,therein.
52436,30,36,7,But if
52437,30,36,8,afflicts them
52438,30,36,9,an evil
52439,30,36,10,for what
52440,30,36,11,have sent forth
52441,30,36,12,"their hands,"
52442,30,36,13,behold!
52443,30,36,14,They
52444,30,36,15,despair.
52445,30,37,1,Do not
52446,30,37,2,they see
52447,30,37,3,that
52448,30,37,4,Allah
52449,30,37,5,extends
52450,30,37,6,the provision
52451,30,37,7,for whom
52452,30,37,8,He wills
52453,30,37,9,and straitens (it).
52454,30,37,10,"Indeed,"
52455,30,37,11,in
52456,30,37,12,that
52457,30,37,13,surely (are) Signs
52458,30,37,14,for a people
52459,30,37,15,who believe.
52460,30,38,1,So give

52462,30,38,3,the relative
52463,30,38,4,his right
52464,30,38,5,and the poor
52465,30,38,6,and
52466,30,38,7,the wayfarer.
52467,30,38,8,That
52468,30,38,9,(is) best
52469,30,38,10,for those who
52470,30,38,11,desire
52471,30,38,12,(the) Countenance

62248,42,7,17,A party
62249,42,7,18,(will be) in
62250,42,7,19,Paradise
62251,42,7,20,and a party
62252,42,7,21,in
62253,42,7,22,the Blazing Fire.
62254,42,8,1,And if
62255,42,8,2,willed
62256,42,8,3,"(by) Allah,"
62257,42,8,4,He could have made them
62258,42,8,5,"a community,"
62259,42,8,6,"one,"
62260,42,8,7,but
62261,42,8,8,He admits
62262,42,8,9,whom
62263,42,8,10,He wills
62264,42,8,11,in (to)
62265,42,8,12,His Mercy.
62266,42,8,13,"And the wrongdoers,"
62267,42,8,14,not

62272,42,8,19,any helper.
62273,42,9,1,Or
62274,42,9,2,have they taken
62275,42,9,3,from
62276,42,9,4,besides Him
62277,42,9,5,protectors?
62278,42,9,6,But Allah -
62279,42,9,7,He
62280,42,9,8,"(is) the Protector,"
62281,42,9,9,and He
62282,42,9,10,gives life
62283,42,9,11,(to) the dead.
62284,42,9,12,And He
62285,42,9,13,(is) on
62286,42,9,14,every
62287,42,9,15,thing
62288,42,9,16,All-Powerful.
62289,42,10,1,And whatever
62290,42,10,2,you differ
62291,42,10,3,in it
62292,42,10,4,of
62293,42,10,5,"a thing,"
62294,42,10,6,then its ruling
62295,42,10,7,(is) to
62296,42,10,8,Allah.
62297,42,10,9,That
62298,42,10,10,"(is) Allah,"
62299,42,10,11,"my Lord,"
62300,42,10,12,upon Him
62301,42,10,13,I put my trust
62302,42,10,14,and to Him
62303,42,10,15,I turn.
62304,42,11,1,(The) Creator
62305,42,11,2,(of) the heavens
62306,42,11,3,and the earth.
62307,42,11,4,He made
62308,42,11,5,for you
62309,42,11,6,from
62310,42,11,7,"yourselves,"
62311,42,11,8,"mates,"
62312,42,11,9,and among
62313,42,11,10,the cattle
62314,42,11,11,mates;
62315,42,11,12,He multiplies you
62316,42,11,13,thereby.
62317,42,11,14,(There) is not
62318,42,11,15,like Him
62319,42,11,16,"anything,"
62320,42,11,17,and He
62321,42,11,18,"(is) the All-Hearer,"
62322,42,11,19,the All-Seer.
62323,42,12,1,To Him (belongs)
62324,42,12,2,(the) keys
62325,42,12,3,(of) the heavens
62326,42,12,4,and the earth.
62327,42,12,5,He extends
62328,42,12,6,the provision
62329,42,12,7,for whom
62330,42,12,8,He wills
62331,42,12,9,and restricts.
62332,42,12,10,"Indeed, He"
62333,42,12,11,of every
62334,42,12,12,thing
62335,42,12,13,(is) All-Knower.
62336,42,13,1,He has ordained
62337,42,13,2,for you
62338,42,13,3,of
62339,42,13,4,the religion
62340,42,13,5,what
62341,42,13,6,He enjoined
62342,42,13,7,upon
62343,42,13,8,"Nuh,"
62344,42,13,9,and that which
62345,42,13,10,We have revealed
62346,42,13,11,"to you,"
62347,42,13,12,and what
62348,42,13,13,We enjoined
62349,42,13,14,upon
62350,42,13,15,Ibrahim
62351,42,13,16,and Musa
62352,42,13,17,and Isa.
62353,42,13,18,To
62354,42,13,19,establish
62355,42,13,20,the religion
62356,42,13,21,and not
62357,42,13,22,be divided
62358,42,13,23,therein.
62359,42,13,24,Is difficult
62360,42,13,25,on
62361,42,13,26,the polytheists
62362,42,13,27,what
62363,42,13,28,you call them

62365,42,13,30,Allah
62366,42,13,31,chooses

62374,42,14,1,And not

62382,42,14,9,"(out of) rivalry,"

62640,42,26,12,severe.
62641,42,27,1,And if
62642,42,27,2,extends
62643,42,27,3,Allah
62644,42,27,4,the provision
62645,42,27,5,"for His slaves,"
62646,42,27,6,surely they would rebel
62647,42,27,7,in
62648,42,27,8,the earth;
62649,42,27,9,but
62650,42,27,10,He sends down
62651,42,27,11,in (due) measure
62652,42,27,12,what
62653,42,27,13,He wills.
62654,42,27,14,"Indeed, He"
62655,42,27,15,of His slaves
62656,42,27,16,"(is) All-Aware,"
62657,42,27,17,All-Seer.
62658,42,28,1,And He
62659,42,28,2,(is) the One Who
62660,42,28,3,sends down
62661,42,28,4,the rain
62662,42,28,5,from
62663,42,28,6,after
62664,42,28,7,[what]
62665,42,28,8,"they have despaired,"
62666,42,28,9,and spreads
62667,42,28,10,His mercy.
62668,42,28,11,And He
62669,42,28,12,"(is) the Protector,"
62670,42,28,13,the Praiseworthy.
62671,42,29,1,And among
62672,42,29,2,His Signs
62673,42,29,3,(is the) creation
62674,42,29,4,(of) the heavens
62675,42,29,5,and the earth
62676,42,29,6,and whatever
62677,42,29,7,He has dispersed
62678,42,29,8,in both of them
62679,42,29,9,of
62680,42,29,10,(the) creatures.
62681,42,29,11,And He
62682,42,29,12,(is) over
62683,42,29,13,"their gathering,"
62684,42,29,14,when
62685,42,29,15,"He wills,"
62686,42,29,16,All-Powerful.
62687,42,30,1,And whatever
62688,42,30,2,befalls you
62689,42,30,3,of
62690,42,30,4,"(the) misfortune,"
62691,42,30,5,(is because) of what
62692,42,30,6,have earned
62693,42,30,7,your hands.
62694,42,30,8,But He pardons
62695,42,30,9,[from]
62696,42,30,10,much.
62697,42,31,1,And not
62698,42,31,2,you
62699,42,31,3,(can) escape
62700,42,31,4,in
62701,42,31,5,"the earth,"
62702,42,31,6,and not
62703,42,31,7,for you
62704,42,31,8,from
62705,42,31,9,besides
62706,42,31,10,Allah
62707,42,31,11,any
62708,42,31,12,protector
62709,42,31,13,and not
62710,42,31,14,any helper.
62711,42,32,1,And among
62712,42,32,2,His Signs
62713,42,32,3,(are) the ships
62714,42,32,4,in
62715,42,32,5,"the sea,"
62716,42,32,6,like [the] mountains.
62717,42,33,1,If
62718,42,33,2,"He wills,"
62719,42,33,3,He can cause to become still
62720,42,33,4,the wind
62721,42,33,5,then they would remain
62722,42,33,6,motionless
62723,42,33,7,on
62724,42,33,8,its back.
62725,42,33,9,"Indeed,"
62726,42,33,10,in
62727,42,33,11,that
62728,42,33,12,surely (are) Signs
62729,42,33,13,for everyone
62730,42,33,14,patient
62731,42,33,15,(and) grateful.
62732,42,34,1,Or
62733,42,34,2,He could destroy them
62734,42,34,3,for what
62735,42,34,4,they have earned;
62736,42,34,5,but He pardons
62737,42,34,6,[from]
62738,42,34,7,much.
62739,42,35,1,And may know
62740,42,35,2,those who
62741,42,35,3,dispute
62742,42,35,4,concerning
62743,42,35,5,Our Signs
62744,42,35,6,(that) not
62745,42,35,7,for them
62746,42,35,8,any
62747,42,35,9,place of refuge.
62748,42,36,1,So whatever
62749,42,36,2,you are given
62750,42,36,3,of
62751,42,36,4,"a thing,"
62752,42,36,5,(is) but a passing enjoyment
62753,42,36,6,(for) the life
62754,42,36,7,(of) the world.
62755,42,36,8,But what
62756,42,36,9,(is) with
62757,42,36,10,Allah
62758,42,36,11,(is) better
62759,42,36,12,and more lasting
62760,42,36,13,for those who
62761,42,36,14,believe
62762,42,36,15,and upon
62763,42,36,16,their Lord
62764,42,36,17,put (their) trust.
62765,42,37,1,And those who
62766,42,37,2,avoid
62767,42,37,3,(the) greater
62768,42,37,4,sins
62769,42,37,5,"and the immoralities,"
62770,42,37,6,and when
62771,42,37,7,[that]
62772,42,37,8,"they are angry,"
62773,42,37,9,they
62774,42,37,10,"forgive,"
62775,42,38,1,And those who
62776,42,38,2,respond
62777,42,38,3,to their Lord
62778,42,38,4,and establish
62779,42,38,5,prayer
62780,42,38,6,and their affairs
62781,42,38,7,(are conducted by) consultation
62782,42,38,8,"among them,"
62783,42,38,9,and from what
62784,42,38,10,We have provided them
62785,42,38,11,"they spend,"
62786,42,39,1,"And those who,"
62787,42,39,2,when
62788,42,39,3,strikes them
62789,42,39,4,"tyranny,"
62790,42,39,5,they
62791,42,39,6,defend themselves.
62792,42,40,1,(The) recompense
62793,42,40,2,(of) an evil
62794,42,40,3,(is) an evil
62795,42,40,4,like it.
62796,42,40,5,But whoever
62797,42,40,6,pardons
62798,42,40,7,"and makes reconciliation,"
62799,42,40,8,then his reward
62800,42,40,9,(is) on
62801,42,40,10,Allah.
62802,42,40,11,"Indeed, He"
62803,42,40,12,(does) not
62804,42,40,13,like
62805,42,40,14,the wrongdoers.
62806,42,41,1,And surely whosoever
62807,42,41,2,defends himself
62808,42,41,3,after
62809,42,41,4,"he has been wronged,"
62810,42,41,5,then those
62811,42,41,6,not
62812,42,41,7,(is) against them
62813,42,41,8,any
62814,42,41,9,way.
62815,42,42,1,Only
62816,42,42,2,the way
62817,42,42,3,against
62818,42,42,4,those who
62819,42,42,5,oppress
62820,42,42,6,the people
62821,42,42,7,and rebel
62822,42,42,8,in
62823,42,42,9,the earth
62824,42,42,10,without
62825,42,42,11,right.
62826,42,42,12,Those
62827,42,42,13,for them
62828,42,42,14,(is) a punishment
62829,42,42,15,painful.
62830,42,43,1,And whoever
62831,42,43,2,(is) patient
62832,42,43,3,"and forgives,"
62833,42,43,4,"indeed,"
62834,42,43,5,that
62835,42,43,6,(is) surely of
62836,42,43,7,matters
62837,42,43,8,(of) determination.
62838,42,44,1,And whoever
62839,42,44,2,lets go astray
62840,42,44,3,(by) Allah
62841,42,44,4,then not

66317,48,25,37,disbelieved
66318,48,25,38,among them
66319,48,25,39,(with) a punishment
66320,48,25,40,painful.
66321,48,26,1,When
66322,48,26,2,had put
66323,48,26,3,those who
66324,48,26,4,disbelieved
66325,48,26,5,in
66326,48,26,6,their hearts
66327,48,26,7,disdain -
66328,48,26,8,(the) disdain
66329,48,26,9,(of the time of) ignorance.
66330,48,26,10,Then sent down
66331,48,26,11,(did) Allah
66332,48,26,12,His tranquility
66333,48,26,13,upon
66334,48,26,14,His Messenger
66335,48,26,15,and upon
66336,48,26,16,the believers
66337,48,26,17,and made them adhere
66338,48,26,18,(to the) word
66339,48,26,19,"(of) righteousness,"
66340,48,26,20,and they were
66341,48,26,21,more deserving
66342,48,26,22,of it
66343,48,26,23,and worthy of it.
66344,48,26,24,And is
66345,48,26,25,Allah
66346,48,26,26,of every
66347,48,26,27,thing
66348,48,26,28,All-Knower.
66349,48,27,1,"Certainly,"
66350,48,27,2,has fulfilled
66351,48,27,3,Allah
66352,48,27,4,His Messenger's
66353,48,27,5,vision
66354,48,27,6,in truth.
66355,48,27,7,"Surely, you will enter"
66356,48,27,8,Al-Masjid
66357,48,27,9,Al-Haraam
66358,48,27,10,if
66359,48,27,11,wills
66360,48,27,12,"Allah,"
66361,48,27,13,"secure,"
66362,48,27,14,having shaved
66363,48,27,15,your heads
66364,48,27,16,"and shortened,"
66365,48,27,17,not
66366,48,27,18,fearing.
66367,48,27,19,But He knew
66368,48,27,20,what
66369,48,27,21,not
66370,48,27,22,"you knew,"
66371,48,27,23,and He made
66372,48,27,24,from
66373,48,27,25,besides
66374,48,27,26,that
66375,48,27,27,a victory
66376,48,27,28,near.
66377,48,28,1,He
66378,48,28,2,(is) the One Who
66379,48,28,3,(has) sent
66380,48,28,4,His Messenger

66382,48,28,6,"and (the) religion,"
66383,48,28,7,the true
66384,48,28,8,that He (may) make it prevail
66385,48,28,9,over
66386,48,28,10,the religions
66387,48,28,11,all.
66388,48,28,12,And sufficient is
66389,48,28,13,Allah
66390,48,28,14,(as) a Witness.
66391,48,29,1,Muhammad
66392,48,29,2,(is the) Messenger
66393,48,29,3,"(of) Allah,"
66394,48,29,4,and those who
66395,48,29,5,(are) with him
66396,48,29,6,(are) firm
66397,48,29,7,against
66398,48,29,8,the disbelievers
66399,48,29,9,and merciful
66400,48,29,10,among themselves.
66401,48,29,11,You see them
66402,48,29,12,bowing
66403,48,29,13,"and prostrating,"
66404,48,29,14,seeking
66405,48,29,15,Bounty
66406,48,29,16,from
66407,48,29,17,Allah
66408,48,29,18,and pleasure.
66409,48,29,19,Their mark
66410,48,29,20,(is) on
66411,48,29,21,their faces
66412,48,29,22,from
66413,48,29,23,(the) trace
66414,48,29,24,(of) the prostration.
66415,48,29,25,That
66416,48,29,26,(is) their similitude
66417,48,29,27,in
66418,48,29,28,the Taurah.
66419,48,29,29,And their similitude
66420,48,29,30,in
66421,48,29,31,"the Injeel,"
66422,48,29,32,(is) like a seed
66423,48,29,33,(which) sends forth
66424,48,29,34,its shoot
66425,48,29,35,"then strengthens it,"
66426,48,29,36,then it becomes thick
66427,48,29,37,and it stands
66428,48,29,38,upon
66429,48,29,39,its stem
66430,48,29,40,delighting
66431,48,29,41,the sowers
66432,48,29,42,that He (may) enrage
66433,48,29,43,by them
66434,48,29,44,the disbelievers.
66435,48,29,45,Has promised
66436,48,29,46,Allah
66437,48,29,47,those who
66438,48,29,48,believe
66439,48,29,49,and do
66440,48,29,50,righteous deeds
66441,48,29,51,"among them,"
66442,48,29,52,forgiveness
66443,48,29,53,and a reward
66444,48,29,54,great.
66445,49,1,1,O you
66446,49,1,2,who
66447,49,1,3,believe!
66448,49,1,4,(Do) not
66449,49,1,5,put (yourselves) forward -
66450,49,1,6,[from]
66451,49,1,7,before

66456,49,1,12,"Indeed,"

66459,49,1,15,All-Knower.
66460,49,2,1,O you
66461,49,2,2,who
66462,49,2,3,believe!
66463,49,2,4,(Do) not
66464,49,2,5,raise
66465,49,2,6,your voices

66467,49,2,8,(the) voice
66468,49,2,9,"(of) the Prophet,"
66469,49,2,10,and (do) not
66470,49,2,11,be loud
66471,49,2,12,to him
66472,49,2,13,in speech
66473,49,2,14,like (the) loudness
66474,49,2,15,(of) some of you
66475,49,2,16,"to others,"
66476,49,2,17,lest
66477,49,2,18,become worthless
66478,49,2,19,your deeds
66479,49,2,20,while you
66480,49,2,21,(do) not
66481,49,2,22,perceive.
66482,49,3,1,"Indeed,"
66483,49,3,2,those who
66484,49,3,3,lower
66485,49,3,4,their voices
66486,49,3,5,(in) presence
66487,49,3,6,(of the) Messenger
66488,49,3,7,(of) Allah -
66489,49,3,8,"those,"

66492,49,3,11,(by) Allah
66493,49,3,12,their hearts
66494,49,3,13,for righteousness.
66495,49,3,14,For them
66496,49,3,15,(is) forgiveness
66497,49,3,16,and a reward
66498,49,3,17,great.
66499,49,4,1,"Indeed,"
66500,49,4,2,those who
66501,49,4,3,call you
66502,49,4,4,from
66503,49,4,5,behind
66504,49,4,6,"the private chambers,"
66505,49,4,7,most of them
66506,49,4,8,(do) not
66507,49,4,9,understand.
66508,49,5,1,And if
66509,49,5,2,they
66510,49,5,3,had been patient
66511,49,5,4,until
66512,49,5,5,you came out
66513,49,5,6,to them
66514,49,5,7,certainly it would be
66515,49,5,8,better
66516,49,5,9,for them.
66517,49,5,10,And Allah
66518,49,5,11,"(is) Oft-Forgiving,"
66519,49,5,12,Most Merciful.
66520,49,6,1,O you
66521,49,6,2,who
66522,49,6,3,believe!
66523,49,6,4,If
66524,49,6,5,comes to you

66527,49,6,8,"investigate,"
66528,49,6,9,lest
66529,49,6,10,you harm
66530,49,6,11,a people

66537,49,7,1,And know
66538,49,7,2,that
66539,49,7,3,among you
66540,49,7,4,(is the) Messenger
66541,49,7,5,(of) Allah.
66542,49,7,6,If
66543,49,7,7,he were to obey you
66544,49,7,8,in
66545,49,7,9,much
66546,49,7,10,of
66547,49,7,11,"the matter,"
66548,49,7,12,"surely you would be in difficulty,"
66549,49,7,13,but
66550,49,7,14,Allah
66551,49,7,15,has endeared
66552,49,7,16,to you
66553,49,7,17,the Faith
66554,49,7,18,and has made it pleasing
66555,49,7,19,in
66556,49,7,20,your hearts
66557,49,7,21,and has made hateful
66558,49,7,22,to you
66559,49,7,23,disbelief
66560,49,7,24,and defiance
66561,49,7,25,and disobedience.
66562,49,7,26,Those
66563,49,7,27,(are) they -
66564,49,7,28,the guided ones.
66565,49,8,1,A Bounty

66570,49,8,6,"(is) All-Knower,"
66571,49,8,7,All-Wise.
66572,49,9,1,And if
66573,49,9,2,two parties

66575,49,9,4,the believers
66576,49,9,5,"fight,"
66577,49,9,6,then make peace
66578,49,9,7,between both of them.
66579,49,9,8,But if
66580,49,9,9,oppresses
66581,49,9,10,one of them
66582,49,9,11,on
66583,49,9,12,"the other,"
66584,49,9,13,then fight

66590,49,9,19,(the) command
66591,49,9,20,(of) Allah.
66592,49,9,21,Then if
66593,49,9,22,"it returns,"
66594,49,9,23,then make peace
66595,49,9,24,between them
66596,49,9,25,"with justice,"
66597,49,9,26,and act justly.
66598,49,9,27,"Indeed,"
66599,49,9,28,Allah
66600,49,9,29,loves
66601,49,9,30,those who act justly.
66602,49,10,1,Only
66603,49,10,2,the believers
66604,49,10,3,"(are) brothers,"
66605,49,10,4,so make peace
66606,49,10,5,between
66607,49,10,6,"your brothers,"
66608,49,10,7,and fear
66609,49,10,8,Allah
66610,49,10,9,so that you may
66611,49,10,10,receive mercy.
66612,49,11,1,O you
66613,49,11,2,who

66620,49,11,9,perhaps
66621,49,11,10,that
66622,49,11,11,they may be
66623,49,11,12,better
66624,49,11,13,than them;
66625,49,11,14,and (let) not

66632,49,11,21,better
66633,49,11,22,than them.
66634,49,11,23,And (do) not

66637,49,11,26,and (do) not
66638,49,11,27,call each other
66639,49,11,28,by nicknames.
66640,49,11,29,Wretched is
66641,49,11,30,the name
66642,49,11,31,(of) disobedience
66643,49,11,32,after
66644,49,11,33,the faith.
66645,49,11,34,And whoever
66646,49,11,35,(does) not

66648,49,11,37,then those -
66649,49,11,38,they
66650,49,11,39,(are) the wrongdoers.
66651,49,12,1,O you
66652,49,12,2,who
66653,49,12,3,believe!
66654,49,12,4,Avoid
66655,49,12,5,much
66656,49,12,6,of

68381,54,29,2,their companion
68382,54,29,3,and he took
68383,54,29,4,and hamstrung.
68384,54,30,1,So how
68385,54,30,2,was
68386,54,30,3,My punishment
68387,54,30,4,and My warnings.
68388,54,31,1,"Indeed, We"
68389,54,31,2,[We] sent
68390,54,31,3,upon them
68391,54,31,4,thunderous blast
68392,54,31,5,"single,"
68393,54,31,6,and they became
68394,54,31,7,like dry twig fragments
68395,54,31,8,(used by) a fence builder.
68396,54,32,1,And certainly
68397,54,32,2,We have made easy
68398,54,32,3,the Quran
68399,54,32,4,"for remembrance,"
68400,54,32,5,so is (there)
68401,54,32,6,any
68402,54,32,7,who will receive admonition?
68403,54,33,1,Denied
68404,54,33,2,(the) people

68406,54,33,4,the warnings.
68407,54,34,1,"Indeed, We"
68408,54,34,2,[We] sent
68409,54,34,3,upon them
68410,54,34,4,"a storm of stones,"
68411,54,34,5,except
68412,54,34,6,(the) family
68413,54,34,7,"(of) Lut,"
68414,54,34,8,We saved them
68415,54,34,9,by dawn
68416,54,35,1,(As) a favor
68417,54,35,2,from
68418,54,35,3,Us.
68419,54,35,4,Thus
68420,54,35,5,We reward
68421,54,35,6,(one) who
68422,54,35,7,(is) grateful.
68423,54,36,1,And certainly
68424,54,36,2,he warned them
68425,54,36,3,"(of) Our seizure,"
68426,54,36,4,but they disputed
68427,54,36,5,the warnings.
68428,54,37,1,And certainly
68429,54,37,2,they demanded from him
68430,54,37,3,[from]
68431,54,37,4,"his guests,"
68432,54,37,5,so We blinded
68433,54,37,6,their eyes.
68434,54,37,7,"""So taste"
68435,54,37,8,My punishment
68436,54,37,9,"and My warnings."""

68439,54,38,3,early
68440,54,38,4,a punishment
68441,54,38,5,abiding.
68442,54,39,1,So taste
68443,54,39,2,My punishment
68444,54,39,3,and My warnings.
68445,54,40,1,And certainly
68446,54,40,2,We have made easy
68447,54,40,3,the Quran
68448,54,40,4,"for remembrance,"
68449,54,40,5,so is (there)

68454,54,41,3,(to the) people
68455,54,41,4,(of) Firaun
68456,54,41,5,warnings.
68457,54,42,1,They denied
68458,54,42,2,"Our Signs,"
68459,54,42,3,"all of them,"
68460,54,42,4,so We seized them
68461,54,42,5,(with) a seizure
68462,54,42,6,"(of) All-Mighty,"
68463,54,42,7,(the) Powerful One.
68464,54,43,1,"Are your disbelievers,"
68465,54,43,2,better
68466,54,43,3,than
68467,54,43,4,"those,"

68472,54,43,9,the Scriptures?
68473,54,44,1,Or
68474,54,44,2,"(do) they say,"
68475,54,44,3,"""We"

68483,54,46,2,the Hour
68484,54,46,3,"(is) their promised time,"
68485,54,46,4,and the Hour
68486,54,46,5,(will be) more grievous
68487,54,46,6,and more bitter.
68488,54,47,1,"Indeed,"
68489,54,47,2,the criminals
68490,54,47,3,(are) in
68491,54,47,4,an error

68539,55,1,1,The Most Gracious
68540,55,2,1,He taught

69606,57,19,20,(of) the Hellfire.
69607,57,20,1,Know
69608,57,20,2,that
69609,57,20,3,the life
69610,57,20,4,(of) the world
69611,57,20,5,(is) play
69612,57,20,6,and amusement
69613,57,20,7,and adornment
69614,57,20,8,and boasting
69615,57,20,9,among you
69616,57,20,10,and competition in increase
69617,57,20,11,of
69618,57,20,12,the wealth
69619,57,20,13,"and the children,"
69620,57,20,14,like (the) example
69621,57,20,15,"(of) a rain,"
69622,57,20,16,pleases
69623,57,20,17,the tillers
69624,57,20,18,its growth;
69625,57,20,19,then
69626,57,20,20,it dries
69627,57,20,21,and you see it
69628,57,20,22,turning yellow;
69629,57,20,23,then
69630,57,20,24,becomes
69631,57,20,25,debris.
69632,57,20,26,And in
69633,57,20,27,the Hereafter
69634,57,20,28,(is) a punishment
69635,57,20,29,severe
69636,57,20,30,and forgiveness
69637,57,20,31,from
69638,57,20,32,Allah
69639,57,20,33,and Pleasure.
69640,57,20,34,But not
69641,57,20,35,(is) the life
69642,57,20,36,(of) the world
69643,57,20,37,except
69644,57,20,38,(the) enjoyment
69645,57,20,39,(of) delusion.
69646,57,21,1,Race
69647,57,21,2,to
69648,57,21,3,(the) forgiveness
69649,57,21,4,from
69650,57,21,5,your Lord
69651,57,21,6,and a Garden
69652,57,21,7,its width
69653,57,21,8,(is) like (the) width
69654,57,21,9,(of) the heaven
69655,57,21,10,"and the earth,"
69656,57,21,11,prepared
69657,57,21,12,for those who
69658,57,21,13,believe
69659,57,21,14,in Allah
69660,57,21,15,and His Messengers.
69661,57,21,16,That
69662,57,21,17,(is the) Bounty
69663,57,21,18,"(of) Allah,"
69664,57,21,19,He gives
69665,57,21,20,(to) whom
69666,57,21,21,He wills.
69667,57,21,22,And Allah
69668,57,21,23,(is) the Possessor
69669,57,21,24,"(of) Bounty,"
69670,57,21,25,the Great.
69671,57,22,1,Not
69672,57,22,2,strikes
69673,57,22,3,any
69674,57,22,4,disaster
69675,57,22,5,in
69676,57,22,6,the earth
69677,57,22,7,and not
69678,57,22,8,in
69679,57,22,9,"yourselves,"
69680,57,22,10,but
69681,57,22,11,in
69682,57,22,12,a Register
69683,57,22,13,from
69684,57,22,14,before
69685,57,22,15,that
69686,57,22,16,We bring it into existence.
69687,57,22,17,"Indeed,"
69688,57,22,18,that
69689,57,22,19,for
69690,57,22,20,Allah
69691,57,22,21,(is) easy.
69692,57,23,1,So that you may not
69693,57,23,2,grieve
69694,57,23,3,over
69695,57,23,4,what
69696,57,23,5,"has escaped you,"
69697,57,23,6,and (do) not
69698,57,23,7,exult
69699,57,23,8,at what
69700,57,23,9,He has given you.
69701,57,23,10,And Allah
69702,57,23,11,(does) not
69703,57,23,12,love
69704,57,23,13,every
69705,57,23,14,self-deluded
69706,57,23,15,"boaster,"
69707,57,24,1,Those who
69708,57,24,2,are stingy
69709,57,24,3,and enjoin
69710,57,24,4,(on) the people
69711,57,24,5,stinginess.
69712,57,24,6,And whoever
69713,57,24,7,"turns away,"
69714,57,24,8,"then indeed,"
69715,57,24,9,"Allah,"
69716,57,24,10,He
69717,57,24,11,"(is) Free of need,"
69718,57,24,12,the Praiseworthy.
69719,57,25,1,Certainly
69720,57,25,2,We sent
69721,57,25,3,Our Messengers
69722,57,25,4,with clear proofs
69723,57,25,5,and We sent down
69724,57,25,6,with them
69725,57,25,7,the Scripture
69726,57,25,8,and the Balance
69727,57,25,9,that may establish
69728,57,25,10,the people
69729,57,25,11,justice.
69730,57,25,12,And We sent down
69731,57,25,13,"[the] iron,"
69732,57,25,14,wherein
69733,57,25,15,(is) power
69734,57,25,16,mighty
69735,57,25,17,and benefits
69736,57,25,18,"for the people,"
69737,57,25,19,and so that may make evident
69738,57,25,20,(by) Allah
69739,57,25,21,(he) who
69740,57,25,22,helps Him
69741,57,25,23,"and His Messengers,"
69742,57,25,24,unseen.
69743,57,25,25,"Indeed,"
69744,57,25,26,Allah
69745,57,25,27,(is) All-Strong
69746,57,25,28,All-Mighty.
69747,57,26,1,And certainly
69748,57,26,2,We sent
69749,57,26,3,Nuh
69750,57,26,4,"and Ibrahim,"
69751,57,26,5,and We placed
69752,57,26,6,in
69753,57,26,7,their offspring
69754,57,26,8,Prophethood
69755,57,26,9,and the Scripture;
69756,57,26,10,and among them
69757,57,26,11,"(is) a guided one,"
69758,57,26,12,but most
69759,57,26,13,of them
69760,57,26,14,(are) defiantly disobediently.
69761,57,27,1,Then
69762,57,27,2,We sent
69763,57,27,3,on
69764,57,27,4,their footsteps
69765,57,27,5,Our Messengers
69766,57,27,6,and We followed
69767,57,27,7,"with Isa,"
69768,57,27,8,son
69769,57,27,9,"(of) Maryam,"
69770,57,27,10,and We gave him
69771,57,27,11,the Injeel.
69772,57,27,12,And We placed
69773,57,27,13,in
69774,57,27,14,(the) hearts
69775,57,27,15,(of) those who
69776,57,27,16,followed him
69777,57,27,17,compassion
69778,57,27,18,and mercy.
69779,57,27,19,But monasticism
69780,57,27,20,they innovated -
69781,57,27,21,not
69782,57,27,22,We prescribed it
69783,57,27,23,for them -
69784,57,27,24,only
69785,57,27,25,seeking
69786,57,27,26,(the) pleasure
69787,57,27,27,"(of) Allah,"
69788,57,27,28,but not
69789,57,27,29,they observed it
69790,57,27,30,(with) right
69791,57,27,31,observance.
69792,57,27,32,So We gave
69793,57,27,33,those who
69794,57,27,34,believed
69795,57,27,35,among them
69796,57,27,36,"their reward,"
69797,57,27,37,but most
69798,57,27,38,of them
69799,57,27,39,(are) defiantly disobediently.
69800,57,28,1,O you
69801,57,28,2,who
69802,57,28,3,believe!
69803,57,28,4,Fear
69804,57,28,5,Allah
69805,57,28,6,and believe
69806,57,28,7,in His Messenger;
69807,57,28,8,He will give you
69808,57,28,9,double portion
69809,57,28,10,of
69810,57,28,11,His Mercy
69811,57,28,12,and He will make
69812,57,28,13,for you
69813,57,28,14,"a light,"
69814,57,28,15,you will walk
69815,57,28,16,"with it,"
69816,57,28,17,and He will forgive
69817,57,28,18,you.
69818,57,28,19,And Allah
69819,57,28,20,"(is) Oft-Forgiving,"
69820,57,28,21,Most Merciful.
69821,57,29,1,So that
69822,57,29,2,may know
69823,57,29,3,(the) People
69824,57,29,4,(of) the Book
69825,57,29,5,that not
69826,57,29,6,they have power
69827,57,29,7,over
69828,57,29,8,anything
69829,57,29,9,from
69830,57,29,10,(the) Bounty
69831,57,29,11,"(of) Allah,"
69832,57,29,12,and that
69833,57,29,13,the Bounty
69834,57,29,14,(is) in (the) Hand
69835,57,29,15,(of) Allah;
69836,57,29,16,He gives it
69837,57,29,17,whom
69838,57,29,18,He wills.
69839,57,29,19,And Allah
69840,57,29,20,(is) the Possessor
69841,57,29,21,(of) Bounty
69842,57,29,22,the Great.
69843,58,1,1,"Indeed,"
69844,58,1,2,has heard
69845,58,1,3,Allah
69846,58,1,4,(the) speech
69847,58,1,5,(of one) who
69848,58,1,6,disputes with you
69849,58,1,7,concerning
69850,58,1,8,her husband
69851,58,1,9,and she directs her complaint
69852,58,1,10,to
69853,58,1,11,Allah.
69854,58,1,12,And Allah
69855,58,1,13,hears
69856,58,1,14,(the) dialogue of both of you.
69857,58,1,15,"Indeed,"
69858,58,1,16,Allah
69859,58,1,17,"(is) All-Hearer,"
69860,58,1,18,All-Seer.
69861,58,2,1,Those who
69862,58,2,2,pronounce zihar
69863,58,2,3,among you
69864,58,2,4,[from]
69865,58,2,5,"(to) their wives,"
69866,58,2,6,not
69867,58,2,7,they
69868,58,2,8,(are) their mothers.
69869,58,2,9,Not
69870,58,2,10,(are) their mothers
69871,58,2,11,except
69872,58,2,12,those who
69873,58,2,13,gave them birth.
69874,58,2,14,"And indeed, they"
69875,58,2,15,surely say
69876,58,2,16,an evil
69877,58,2,17,[of]
69878,58,2,18,[the] word
69879,58,2,19,and a lie.
69880,58,2,20,"But indeed,"
69881,58,2,21,Allah
69882,58,2,22,"(is) surely, Oft-Pardoning,"
69883,58,2,23,Oft-Forgiving.
69884,58,3,1,And those who
69885,58,3,2,pronounce zihar
69886,58,3,3,[from]
69887,58,3,4,(to) their wives
69888,58,3,5,then
69889,58,3,6,go back
69890,58,3,7,on what
69891,58,3,8,"they said,"
69892,58,3,9,then freeing
69893,58,3,10,(of) a slave
69894,58,3,11,from
69895,58,3,12,before
69896,58,3,13,[that]
69897,58,3,14,they touch each other.
69898,58,3,15,That
69899,58,3,16,you are admonished
69900,58,3,17,to it.
69901,58,3,18,And Allah
69902,58,3,19,of what
69903,58,3,20,you do
69904,58,3,21,(is) All-Aware.
69905,58,4,1,Then whoever
69906,58,4,2,(does) not
69907,58,4,3,"find,"
69908,58,4,4,then fasting
69909,58,4,5,(for) two months
69910,58,4,6,consecutively
69911,58,4,7,from
69912,58,4,8,before
69913,58,4,9,[that]
69914,58,4,10,they both touch each other.
69915,58,4,11,But (he) who
69916,58,4,12,not
69917,58,4,13,is able
69918,58,4,14,then (the) feeding
69919,58,4,15,(of) sixty
69920,58,4,16,needy one(s).
69921,58,4,17,That -
69922,58,4,18,so that you may believe
69923,58,4,19,in Allah
69924,58,4,20,"and His Messenger,"
69925,58,4,21,and these
69926,58,4,22,(are the) limits
69927,58,4,23,"(of) Allah,"
69928,58,4,24,and for the disbelievers
69929,58,4,25,(is) a punishment
69930,58,4,26,painful.
69931,58,5,1,"Indeed,"
69932,58,5,2,those who
69933,58,5,3,oppose
69934,58,5,4,Allah
69935,58,5,5,and His Messenger
69936,58,5,6,(will) be disgraced
69937,58,5,7,as
69938,58,5,8,were disgraced
69939,58,5,9,those
69940,58,5,10,from
69941,58,5,11,before them.
69942,58,5,12,And certainly
69943,58,5,13,We have sent down
69944,58,5,14,Verses
69945,58,5,15,clear.
69946,58,5,16,And for the disbelievers
69947,58,5,17,(is) a punishment
69948,58,5,18,humiliating.
69949,58,6,1,(On the) Day
69950,58,6,2,(when) will raise them
69951,58,6,3,Allah
69952,58,6,4,all
69953,58,6,5,and inform them
69954,58,6,6,of what
69955,58,6,7,they did.
69956,58,6,8,Has recorded it
69957,58,6,9,Allah
69958,58,6,10,while they forgot it.
69959,58,6,11,And Allah
69960,58,6,12,(is) over
69961,58,6,13,all
69962,58,6,14,things
69963,58,6,15,a Witness.
69964,58,7,1,Do not
69965,58,7,2,you see
69966,58,7,3,that
69967,58,7,4,Allah
69968,58,7,5,knows
69969,58,7,6,whatever
69970,58,7,7,(is) in
69971,58,7,8,the heavens
69972,58,7,9,and whatever
69973,58,7,10,(is) in
69974,58,7,11,the earth?
69975,58,7,12,Not
69976,58,7,13,there is
69977,58,7,14,any
69978,58,7,15,secret counsel
69979,58,7,16,(of) three
69980,58,7,17,but
69981,58,7,18,He (is)
69982,58,7,19,"(the) fourth of them,"
69983,58,7,20,and not
69984,58,7,21,five
69985,58,7,22,but
69986,58,7,23,He (is)
69987,58,7,24,"(the) sixth of them,"
69988,58,7,25,and not
69989,58,7,26,less
69990,58,7,27,than
69991,58,7,28,that
69992,58,7,29,and not
69993,58,7,30,more
69994,58,7,31,but
69995,58,7,32,He
69996,58,7,33,(is) with them
69997,58,7,34,wherever
69998,58,7,35,(that)
69999,58,7,36,they are.
70000,58,7,37,Then
70001,58,7,38,He will inform them
70002,58,7,39,of what
70003,58,7,40,they did
70004,58,7,41,(on the) Day
70005,58,7,42,(of) the Resurrection.
70006,58,7,43,"Indeed,"
70007,58,7,44,Allah
70008,58,7,45,of every
70009,58,7,46,thing
70010,58,7,47,(is) All-Knower.
70011,58,8,1,Do not
70012,58,8,2,you see

71673,63,11,1,But never

71677,63,11,5,when
71678,63,11,6,has come
71679,63,11,7,its term.
71680,63,11,8,And Allah
71681,63,11,9,(is) All-Aware
71682,63,11,10,of what
71683,63,11,11,you do.
71684,64,1,1,Glorifies
71685,64,1,2,[to] Allah
71686,64,1,3,whatever
71687,64,1,4,(is) in

71690,64,1,7,(is) in
71691,64,1,8,the earth.
71692,64,1,9,For Him
71693,64,1,10,(is the) dominion
71694,64,1,11,and for Him
71695,64,1,12,(is) the praise.
71696,64,1,13,And He
71697,64,1,14,(is) on
71698,64,1,15,every
71699,64,1,16,thing
71700,64,1,17,All-Powerful.
71701,64,2,1,He

71708,64,2,8,And Allah
71709,64,2,9,of what
71710,64,2,10,you do
71711,64,2,11,(is) All-Seer.
71712,64,3,1,He created
71713,64,3,2,the heavens
71714,64,3,3,and the earth
71715,64,3,4,"with truth,"
71716,64,3,5,and He formed you
71717,64,3,6,and made good
71718,64,3,7,"your forms,"
71719,64,3,8,and to Him
71720,64,3,9,(is) the final return.
71721,64,4,1,He knows
71722,64,4,2,what
71723,64,4,3,(is) in
71724,64,4,4,the heavens

71726,64,4,6,and He knows
71727,64,4,7,what
71728,64,4,8,you conceal
71729,64,4,9,and what
71730,64,4,10,you declare.
71731,64,4,11,And Allah
71732,64,4,12,(is) All-Knowing

71734,64,4,14,(is in) the breasts.
71735,64,5,1,Has not
71736,64,5,2,come to you
71737,64,5,3,(the) news
71738,64,5,4,(of) those who
71739,64,5,5,disbelieved
71740,64,5,6,from
71741,64,5,7,before?
71742,64,5,8,So they tasted
71743,64,5,9,(the bad) consequence
71744,64,5,10,"(of) their affair,"
71745,64,5,11,and for them
71746,64,5,12,(is) a punishment
71747,64,5,13,painful.
71748,64,6,1,That
71749,64,6,2,(is) because
71750,64,6,3,had
71751,64,6,4,come to them
71752,64,6,5,their Messengers
71753,64,6,6,"with clear proofs,"
71754,64,6,7,"but they said,"
71755,64,6,8,"""Shall human beings"
71756,64,6,9,"guide us?"""
71757,64,6,10,So they disbelieved

71759,64,6,12,And can do without them
71760,64,6,13,Allah.
71761,64,6,14,And Allah
71762,64,6,15,"(is) Self-sufficient,"

71789,64,8,8,of what
71790,64,8,9,"you do,"
71791,64,8,10,(is) All-Aware.
71792,64,9,1,(The) Day
71793,64,9,2,He will assemble you
71794,64,9,3,for (the) Day

71796,64,9,5,that
71797,64,9,6,(will be the) Day
71798,64,9,7,(of) mutual loss and gain.

71800,64,9,9,believes
71801,64,9,10,in Allah
71802,64,9,11,and does
71803,64,9,12,righteous deeds

71805,64,9,14,from him
71806,64,9,15,his evil deeds
71807,64,9,16,and He will admit him

71817,64,9,26,(is) the success

71819,64,10,1,But those who
71820,64,10,2,disbelieved

71850,64,12,5,but if

71862,64,13,6,And upon
71863,64,13,7,Allah
71864,64,13,8,let put (their) trust
71865,64,13,9,the believers.
71866,64,14,1,O you
71867,64,14,2,who
71868,64,14,3,believe!
71869,64,14,4,"Indeed,"
71870,64,14,5,from
71871,64,14,6,your spouses
71872,64,14,7,and your children
71873,64,14,8,(are) enemies

71878,64,14,13,and overlook
71879,64,14,14,"and forgive,"
71880,64,14,15,"then indeed,"
71881,64,14,16,Allah
71882,64,14,17,"(is) Oft-Forgiving,"
71883,64,14,18,Most Merciful.
71884,64,15,1,Only
71885,64,15,2,your wealth
71886,64,15,3,and your children
71887,64,15,4,"(are) a trial,"
71888,64,15,5,and Allah -
71889,64,15,6,with Him
71890,64,15,7,(is) a reward

71894,64,16,3,what
71895,64,16,4,you are able
71896,64,16,5,and listen
71897,64,16,6,and obey
71898,64,16,7,and spend;
71899,64,16,8,(it is) better
71900,64,16,9,for yourselves.
71901,64,16,10,And whoever
71902,64,16,11,is saved
71903,64,16,12,(from the) greediness
71904,64,16,13,"(of) his soul,"
71905,64,16,14,then those
71906,64,16,15,[they]
71907,64,16,16,(are) the successful ones.
71908,64,17,1,If
71909,64,17,2,you loan
71910,64,17,3,(to) Allah
71911,64,17,4,a loan
71912,64,17,5,"goodly,"
71913,64,17,6,He will multiply it
71914,64,17,7,for you
71915,64,17,8,and will forgive
71916,64,17,9,you.
71917,64,17,10,And Allah
71918,64,17,11,"(is) Most Appreciative,"
71919,64,17,12,"Most Forbearing,"
71920,64,18,1,(The) Knower

71924,64,18,5,the All-Wise.
71925,65,1,1,O
71926,65,1,2,Prophet!
71927,65,1,3,When
71928,65,1,4,you divorce
71929,65,1,5,"[the] women,"
71930,65,1,6,then divorce them
71931,65,1,7,"for their waiting period,"
71932,65,1,8,and keep count
71933,65,1,9,"(of) the waiting period,"
71934,65,1,10,and fear
71935,65,1,11,"Allah,"
71936,65,1,12,your Lord.
71937,65,1,13,(Do) not
71938,65,1,14,expel them
71939,65,1,15,from
71940,65,1,16,"their houses,"
71941,65,1,17,and not
71942,65,1,18,they should leave
71943,65,1,19,except
71944,65,1,20,that
71945,65,1,21,they commit
71946,65,1,22,an immorality
71947,65,1,23,clear.
71948,65,1,24,And these
71949,65,1,25,(are the) limits
71950,65,1,26,(of) Allah.
71951,65,1,27,And whoever
71952,65,1,28,transgresses
71953,65,1,29,(the) limits
71954,65,1,30,(of) Allah
71955,65,1,31,then certainly
71956,65,1,32,he has wronged
71957,65,1,33,himself.
71958,65,1,34,Not
71959,65,1,35,you know;
71960,65,1,36,Perhaps
71961,65,1,37,Allah
71962,65,1,38,"will bring about,"
71963,65,1,39,after
71964,65,1,40,"that,"
71965,65,1,41,a matter.
71966,65,2,1,Then when
71967,65,2,2,they have reached
71968,65,2,3,"their term,"
71969,65,2,4,then retain them
71970,65,2,5,with kindness
71971,65,2,6,or
71972,65,2,7,part with them
71973,65,2,8,with kindness.
71974,65,2,9,And take witness
71975,65,2,10,two men
71976,65,2,11,just
71977,65,2,12,among you
71978,65,2,13,and establish
71979,65,2,14,the testimony
71980,65,2,15,for Allah.
71981,65,2,16,That
71982,65,2,17,"is instructed,"
71983,65,2,18,"with it,"
71984,65,2,19,whoever
71985,65,2,20,[is]
71986,65,2,21,believes
71987,65,2,22,in Allah
71988,65,2,23,and the Day
71989,65,2,24,the Last.
71990,65,2,25,And whoever
71991,65,2,26,fears
71992,65,2,27,"Allah,"
71993,65,2,28,He will make
71994,65,2,29,for him
71995,65,2,30,"a way out,"
71996,65,3,1,And He will provide for him
71997,65,3,2,from
71998,65,3,3,where
71999,65,3,4,not
72000,65,3,5,he thinks.
72001,65,3,6,And whoever
72002,65,3,7,puts his trust
72003,65,3,8,upon
72004,65,3,9,"Allah,"
72005,65,3,10,then He
72006,65,3,11,(is) sufficient for him.
72007,65,3,12,"Indeed,"
72008,65,3,13,Allah
72009,65,3,14,(will) accomplish
72010,65,3,15,His purpose.
72011,65,3,16,"Indeed,"
72012,65,3,17,has set

72017,65,4,1,And those who
72018,65,4,2,have despaired
72019,65,4,3,of
72020,65,4,4,the menstruation
72021,65,4,5,among
72022,65,4,6,"your women,"
72023,65,4,7,if
72024,65,4,8,"you doubt,"
72025,65,4,9,then their waiting period
72026,65,4,10,(is) three
72027,65,4,11,"months,"
72028,65,4,12,and the ones who
72029,65,4,13,not
72030,65,4,14,[they] menstruated.
72031,65,4,15,And those who (are)

72034,65,4,18,until
72035,65,4,19,they deliver
72036,65,4,20,their burdens.
72037,65,4,21,And whoever
72038,65,4,22,fears
72039,65,4,23,"Allah,"
72040,65,4,24,He will make
72041,65,4,25,for him
72042,65,4,26,of
72043,65,4,27,his affair
72044,65,4,28,ease.
72045,65,5,1,That
72046,65,5,2,(is the) Command
72047,65,5,3,"(of) Allah,"
72048,65,5,4,which He has sent down
72049,65,5,5,to you;
72050,65,5,6,and whoever
72051,65,5,7,fears
72052,65,5,8,"Allah,"
72053,65,5,9,He will remove
72054,65,5,10,from him
72055,65,5,11,his evil deeds
72056,65,5,12,and make great
72057,65,5,13,for him
72058,65,5,14,(his) reward.
72059,65,6,1,Lodge them
72060,65,6,2,from
72061,65,6,3,where
72062,65,6,4,"you dwell,"
72063,65,6,5,(out) of
72064,65,6,6,your means
72065,65,6,7,and (do) not
72066,65,6,8,harm them
72067,65,6,9,to distress
72068,65,6,10,[on] them.
72069,65,6,11,And if
72070,65,6,12,they are
72071,65,6,13,those (who are)
72072,65,6,14,"pregnant,"

72076,65,6,18,they deliver
72077,65,6,19,their burden.
72078,65,6,20,Then if
72079,65,6,21,they suckle
72080,65,6,22,"for you,"
72081,65,6,23,then give them
72082,65,6,24,"their payment,"
72083,65,6,25,and consult
72084,65,6,26,among yourselves

73107,69,5,3,they were destroyed
73108,69,5,4,by the overpowering (blast).
73109,69,6,1,And as for
73110,69,6,2,"Aad,"
73111,69,6,3,they were destroyed

73142,69,10,2,(the) Messenger
73143,69,10,3,"(of) their Lord,"
73144,69,10,4,so He seized them

75397,79,29,3,and brought out
75398,79,29,4,its brightness.
75399,79,30,1,And the earth
75400,79,30,2,after
75401,79,30,3,that
75402,79,30,4,He spread it.
75403,79,31,1,He brought forth
75404,79,31,2,"from it,"
75405,79,31,3,its water
75406,79,31,4,"and its pasture,"
75407,79,32,1,"And the mountains,"
75408,79,32,2,"He made them firm,"
75409,79,33,1,(As) a provision
75410,79,33,2,for you
75411,79,33,3,and for your cattle.
75412,79,34,1,But when
75413,79,34,2,comes
75414,79,34,3,the Overwhelming Calamity
75415,79,34,4,"the great,"
75416,79,35,1,(The) Day
75417,79,35,2,will remember
75418,79,35,3,man
75419,79,35,4,what
75420,79,35,5,"he strove (for),"
75421,79,36,1,And will be made manifest
75422,79,36,2,the Hellfire
75423,79,36,3,to (him) who
75424,79,36,4,"sees,"
75425,79,37,1,Then as for
75426,79,37,2,(him) who
75427,79,37,3,"transgressed,"
75428,79,38,1,And preferred
75429,79,38,2,the life
75430,79,38,3,"(of) the world,"
75431,79,39,1,"Then indeed,"
75432,79,39,2,"the Hellfire,"
75433,79,39,3,it
75434,79,39,4,(is) the refuge.
75435,79,40,1,But as for
75436,79,40,2,(him) who
75437,79,40,3,feared
75438,79,40,4,standing
75439,79,40,5,"(before) his Lord,"
75440,79,40,6,and restrained
75441,79,40,7,his soul
75442,79,40,8,from
75443,79,40,9,"the vain desires,"
75444,79,41,1,"Then indeed,"
75445,79,41,2,Paradise -
75446,79,41,3,it (is)
75447,79,41,4,the refuge.
75448,79,42,1,They ask you
75449,79,42,2,about
75450,79,42,3,"the Hour,"
75451,79,42,4,when
75452,79,42,5,(is) its arrival?
75453,79,43,1,In what
75454,79,43,2,(are) you
75455,79,43,3,[of]
75456,79,43,4,(to) mention it?
75457,79,44,1,To
75458,79,44,2,your Lord
75459,79,44,3,(is) its finality.
75460,79,45,1,Only
75461,79,45,2,you
75462,79,45,3,(are) a warner
75463,79,45,4,(for him) who
75464,79,45,5,fears it.
75465,79,46,1,"As though they,"
75466,79,46,2,(the) Day
75467,79,46,3,"they see it,"
75468,79,46,4,not
75469,79,46,5,they had remained
75470,79,46,6,except
75471,79,46,7,an evening
75472,79,46,8,or
75473,79,46,9,a morning thereof.
75474,80,1,1,He frowned
75475,80,1,2,"and turned away,"
75476,80,2,1,Because
75477,80,2,2,came to him
75478,80,2,3,the blind man.
75479,80,3,1,But what
75480,80,3,2,would make you know
75481,80,3,3,that he might
75482,80,3,4,"purify himself,"
75483,80,4,1,Or
75484,80,4,2,be reminded
75485,80,4,3,so would benefit him
75486,80,4,4,the reminder?
75487,80,5,1,As for
75488,80,5,2,(him) who
75489,80,5,3,"considers himself free from need,"
75490,80,6,1,So you
75491,80,6,2,to him
75492,80,6,3,give attention.
75493,80,7,1,And not
75494,80,7,2,upon you
75495,80,7,3,that not
75496,80,7,4,he purifies himself.
75497,80,8,1,But as for
75498,80,8,2,(he) who
75499,80,8,3,came to you
75500,80,8,4,"striving,"
75501,80,9,1,While he
75502,80,9,2,"fears,"
75503,80,10,1,But you
75504,80,10,2,from him
75505,80,10,3,(are) distracted.
75506,80,11,1,Nay!
75507,80,11,2,"Indeed, it"
75508,80,11,3,"(is) a reminder,"
75509,80,12,1,So whosoever
75510,80,12,2,wills
75511,80,12,3,may remember it.
75512,80,13,1,In
75513,80,13,2,sheets
75514,80,13,3,"honored,"
75515,80,14,1,"Exalted,"
75516,80,14,2,"purified,"
75517,80,15,1,In (the) hands
75518,80,15,2,(of) scribes.
75519,80,16,1,"Noble,"
75520,80,16,2,dutiful.
75521,80,17,1,Is destroyed
75522,80,17,2,"[the] man,"
75523,80,17,3,how
75524,80,17,4,ungrateful is he!
75525,80,18,1,From
75526,80,18,2,what
75527,80,18,3,thing
75528,80,18,4,He created him?
75529,80,19,1,From
75530,80,19,2,a semen-drop
75531,80,19,3,"He created him,"
75532,80,19,4,"then He proportioned him,"
75533,80,20,1,Then
75534,80,20,2,"the way,"
75535,80,20,3,"He made easy for him,"
75536,80,21,1,Then
75537,80,21,2,He causes him to die
75538,80,21,3,"and provides a grave for him,"
75539,80,22,1,Then
75540,80,22,2,when
75541,80,22,3,"He wills,"
75542,80,22,4,He will resurrect him.
75543,80,23,1,Nay!
75544,80,23,2,Not
75545,80,23,3,he has accomplished
75546,80,23,4,what
75547,80,23,5,He commanded him.
75548,80,24,1,Then let look
75549,80,24,2,the man
75550,80,24,3,at
75551,80,24,4,"his food,"
75552,80,25,1,That [We]
75553,80,25,2,[We] poured
75554,80,25,3,the water
75555,80,25,4,"(in) abundance,"
75556,80,26,1,Then
75557,80,26,2,We cleaved
75558,80,26,3,the earth
75559,80,26,4,"splitting,"
75560,80,27,1,Then We caused to grow
75561,80,27,2,therein
75562,80,27,3,"grain,"
75563,80,28,1,And grapes
75564,80,28,2,"and green fodder,"
75565,80,29,1,And olive
75566,80,29,2,"and date-palms,"
75567,80,30,1,And gardens
75568,80,30,2,"(of) thick foliage,"
75569,80,31,1,And fruits
75570,80,31,2,"and grass,"
75571,80,32,1,(As) a provision
75572,80,32,2,for you
75573,80,32,3,and for your cattle.
75574,80,33,1,But when
75575,80,33,2,comes
75576,80,33,3,"the Deafening Blast,"
75577,80,34,1,(The) Day
75578,80,34,2,will flee
75579,80,34,3,a man
75580,80,34,4,from
75581,80,34,5,"his brother,"
75582,80,35,1,And his mother
75583,80,35,2,"and his father,"
75584,80,36,1,And his wife
75585,80,36,2,"and his children,"
75586,80,37,1,For every
75587,80,37,2,man
75588,80,37,3,among them
75589,80,37,4,that Day
75590,80,37,5,(will be) a matter
75591,80,37,6,occupying him.
75592,80,38,1,"Faces,"
75593,80,38,2,that Day
75594,80,38,3,"(will be) bright,"
75595,80,39,1,"Laughing,"
75596,80,39,2,rejoicing at good news.
75597,80,40,1,"And faces,"
75598,80,40,2,"that Day,"
75599,80,40,3,upon them
75600,80,40,4,"(will be) dust,"
75601,80,41,1,Will cover them
75602,80,41,2,darkness.
75603,80,42,1,Those
75604,80,42,2,[they]
75605,80,42,3,"(are) the disbelievers,"
75606,80,42,4,the wicked ones.
75607,81,1,1,When
75608,81,1,2,the sun
75609,81,1,3,"is wrapped up,"
75610,81,2,1,And when
75611,81,2,2,the stars
75612,81,2,3,"fall, losing their luster"
75613,81,3,1,And when
75614,81,3,2,the mountains
75615,81,3,3,"are moved away,"
75616,81,4,1,And when
75617,81,4,2,the full-term she-camels
75618,81,4,3,(are) left untended;
75619,81,5,1,And when
75620,81,5,2,the wild beasts
75621,81,5,3,"are gathered,"
75622,81,6,1,And when
75623,81,6,2,the seas
75624,81,6,3,"are made to overflow,"
75625,81,7,1,And when
75626,81,7,2,the souls
75627,81,7,3,"are paired,"
75628,81,8,1,And when
75629,81,8,2,the female infant buried alive
75630,81,8,3,is asked
75631,81,9,1,For what
75632,81,9,2,sin
75633,81,9,3,she was killed.
75634,81,10,1,And when
75635,81,10,2,the pages
75636,81,10,3,"are laid open,"
75637,81,11,1,And when
75638,81,11,2,the sky
75639,81,11,3,"is stripped away,"
75640,81,12,1,And when
75641,81,12,2,the Hellfire
75642,81,12,3,"is set ablaze,"
75643,81,13,1,And when
75644,81,13,2,Paradise
75645,81,13,3,"is brought near,"
75646,81,14,1,Will know
75647,81,14,2,a soul
75648,81,14,3,what
75649,81,14,4,it has brought.
75650,81,15,1,But nay!
75651,81,15,2,I swear
75652,81,15,3,"by the retreating planets,"
75653,81,16,1,Those that run
75654,81,16,2,"(and) disappear,"
75655,81,17,1,And the night
75656,81,17,2,when
75657,81,17,3,"it departs,"
75658,81,18,1,And the dawn
75659,81,18,2,when
75660,81,18,3,it breathes
75661,81,19,1,"Indeed, it"
75662,81,19,2,(is) surely a word
75663,81,19,3,(of) a Messenger
75664,81,19,4,"noble,"
75665,81,20,1,Possessor of
75666,81,20,2,"power,"
75667,81,20,3,with

75672,81,21,2,and
75673,81,21,3,"trustworthy,"
75674,81,22,1,And not
75675,81,22,2,(is) your companion
75676,81,22,3,mad.
75677,81,23,1,And certainly
75678,81,23,2,he saw him
75679,81,23,3,in the horizon
75680,81,23,4,the clear.
75681,81,24,1,And not
75682,81,24,2,he (is)
75683,81,24,3,on
75684,81,24,4,the unseen
75685,81,24,5,a withholder.
75686,81,25,1,And not
75687,81,25,2,it
75688,81,25,3,(is the) word
75689,81,25,4,(of) Shaitaan
75690,81,25,5,accursed.
75691,81,26,1,So where
75692,81,26,2,are you going?
75693,81,27,1,Not
75694,81,27,2,it
75695,81,27,3,(is) except
75696,81,27,4,a reminder
75697,81,27,5,"to the worlds,"
75698,81,28,1,For whoever
75699,81,28,2,wills
75700,81,28,3,among you
75701,81,28,4,to
75702,81,28,5,take a straight way.
75703,81,29,1,And not
75704,81,29,2,you will
75705,81,29,3,except
75706,81,29,4,that
75707,81,29,5,wills
75708,81,29,6,"Allah,"
75709,81,29,7,Lord
75710,81,29,8,(of) the worlds.
75711,82,1,1,When
75712,82,1,2,the sky
75713,82,1,3,"(is) cleft asunder,"
75714,82,2,1,And when
75715,82,2,2,the stars
75716,82,2,3,"scatter,"
75717,82,3,1,And when
75718,82,3,2,the seas
75719,82,3,3,"are made to gush forth,"
75720,82,4,1,And when
75721,82,4,2,the graves
75722,82,4,3,"are overturned,"
75723,82,5,1,Will know
75724,82,5,2,a soul
75725,82,5,3,what
75726,82,5,4,it has sent forth
75727,82,5,5,and left behind.
75728,82,6,1,O
75729,82,6,2,man!
75730,82,6,3,What
75731,82,6,4,has deceived you
75732,82,6,5,concerning your Lord
75733,82,6,6,"the Most Noble,"
75734,82,7,1,Who
75735,82,7,2,"created you,"
75736,82,7,3,then fashioned you
75737,82,7,4,then balanced you?
75738,82,8,1,In
75739,82,8,2,whatever
75740,82,8,3,form
75741,82,8,4,what
75742,82,8,5,"He willed,"
75743,82,8,6,He assembled you.
75744,82,9,1,Nay!
75745,82,9,2,But
75746,82,9,3,you deny
75747,82,9,4,the Judgment.

75749,82,10,2,over you
75750,82,10,3,"(are) surely guardians,"

75756,82,13,1,"Indeed,"
75757,82,13,2,the righteous
75758,82,13,3,(will be) surely in
75759,82,13,4,"bliss,"
75760,82,14,1,"And indeed,"
75761,82,14,2,the wicked
75762,82,14,3,(will be) surely in
75763,82,14,4,Hellfire.
75764,82,15,1,They will burn (in) it
75765,82,15,2,(on the) Day
75766,82,15,3,"(of) the Judgment,"
75767,82,16,1,And not
75768,82,16,2,they
75769,82,16,3,from it
75770,82,16,4,(will be) absent.
75771,82,17,1,And what
75772,82,17,2,can make you know
75773,82,17,3,what
75774,82,17,4,(is the) Day
75775,82,17,5,(of) the Judgment?
75776,82,18,1,"Then,"
75777,82,18,2,what
75778,82,18,3,can make you know
75779,82,18,4,what
75780,82,18,5,(is the) Day

75782,82,19,1,(The) Day
75783,82,19,2,not
75784,82,19,3,will have power
75785,82,19,4,a soul

75790,82,19,9,(will be) with Allah.
75791,83,1,1,Woe

76669,91,14,6,for their sin
76670,91,14,7,and leveled them.
76671,91,15,1,And not

76693,92,7,1,Then We will ease him
76694,92,7,2,towards [the] ease.
76695,92,8,1,But as for
76696,92,8,2,(him) who
76697,92,8,3,withholds

76699,92,9,1,And denies

76746,93,2,1,And the night
76747,93,2,2,when
76748,93,2,3,"it covers with darkness,"
76749,93,3,1,Not

76751,93,3,3,your Lord
76752,93,3,4,and not

76755,93,4,2,(is) better
76756,93,4,3,for you
76757,93,4,4,than
76758,93,4,5,the first.
76759,93,5,1,And soon
76760,93,5,2,will give you
76761,93,5,3,your Lord
76762,93,5,4,then you will be satisfied.
76763,93,6,1,Did not

76765,93,6,3,an orphan
76766,93,6,4,and give shelter?
76767,93,7,1,And He found you
76768,93,7,2,"lost,"
